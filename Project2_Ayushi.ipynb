DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               The PARAMOUNT Logo is presented austerely over a black \n               background. There is a moment's hesitation, and then the \n               simple words in white lettering:\n\n                                      THE GODFATHER\n\n               While this remains, we hear: \"I believe in America.\" Suddenly \n               we are watching in CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, a man of \n               sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great emotion.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         America has made my fortune.\n\n               As he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to loosen.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         I raised my daughter in the American \n                         fashion; I gave her freedom, but \n                         taught her never to dishonor her \n                         family. She found a boy friend, not \n                         an Italian. She went to the movies \n                         with him, stayed out late. Two months \n                         ago he took her for a drive, with \n                         another boy friend. They made her \n                         drink whiskey and then they tried to \n                         take advantage of her. She resisted; \n                         she kept her honor. So they beat her \n                         like an animal. When I went to the \n                         hospital her nose was broken, her \n                         jaw was shattered and held together \n                         by wire, and she could not even weep \n                         because of the pain.\n\n               He can barely speak; he is weeping now.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         I went to the Police like a good \n                         American. These two boys were arrested \n                         and brought to trial. The judge \n                         sentenced them to three years in \n                         prison, and suspended the sentence. \n                         Suspended sentence! They went free \n                         that very day. I stood in the \n                         courtroom like a fool, and those \n                         bastards, they smiled at me. Then I \n                         said to my wife, for Justice, we \n                         must go to The Godfather.\n\n               By now, THE VIEW is full, and we see Don Corleone's office \n\n\n\n               in his home.\n\n               The blinds are closed, and so the room is dark, and with \n               patterned shadows. We are watching BONASERA over the shoulder \n               of DON CORLEONE. TOM HAGEN sits near a small table, examining \n               some paperwork, and SONNY CORLEONE stands impatiently by the \n               window nearest his father, sipping from a glass of wine. We \n               can HEAR music, and the laughter and voices of many people \n               outside.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Bonasera, we know each other for \n                         years, but this is the first time \n                         you come to me for help. I don't \n                         remember the last time you invited \n                         me to your house for coffee... even \n                         though our wives are friends.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         What do you want of me? I'll give \n                         you anything you want, but do what I \n                         ask!\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         And what is that Bonasera?\n\n               BONASERA whispers into the DON's ear.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         No. You ask for too much.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         I ask for Justice.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         The Court gave you justice.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         An eye for an eye!\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         But your daughter is still alive.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         Then make them suffer as she suffers.  \n                         How much shall I pay you.\n\n               Both HAGEN and SONNY react.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         You never think to protect yourself \n                         with real friends. You think it's \n                         enough to be an American. All right, \n                         the Police protects you, there are \n                         Courts of Law, so you don't need a \n                         friend like me. But now you come to \n                         me and say Don Corleone, you must \n                         give me justice. And you don't ask \n                         in respect or friendship. And you \n                         don't think to call me Godfather; \n                         instead you come to my house on the \n                         day my daughter is to be married and \n                         you ask me to do murder... for money.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         America has been good to me...\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Then take the justice from the judge, \n\n\n\n                         the bitter with the sweet, Bonasera.  \n                         But if you come to me with your \n                         friendship, your loyalty, then your \n                         enemies become my enemies, and then, \n                         believe me, they would fear you...\n\n               Slowly, Bonasera bows his head and murmurs.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         Be my friend.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Good. From me you'll get Justice.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         Godfather.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Some day, and that day may never \n                         come, I would like to call upon you \n                         to do me a service in return.\n\n               EXT. DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               A HIGH ANGLE of the CORLEONE MALL in bright daylight. There \n               are at least five hundred guests filling the main courtyard \n               and gardens. There is music and laughing and dancing and \n               countless tables covered with food and wine.\n\n               DON CORLEONE stands at the Gate, flanked on either side by a \n               son: FREDO and SONNY, all dressed in the formal attire of \n               the wedding party. He warmly shakes the hands, squeezes the \n               hands of the friends and guests, pinches the cheeks of the \n               children, and makes them all welcome. They in turn carry \n               with them gallons of homemade wine, cartons of freshly baked \n               bread and pastries, and enormous trays of Italian delicacies.\n\n               The entire family poses for a family portrait: DON CORLEONE, \n               MAMA, SONNY, his wife, SANDRA, and their children, TOM HAGEN \n               and his wife, THERESA, and their BABY; CONSTANZIA, the bride, \n               and her bridegroom, CARLO RIZZI. As they move into the pose, \n               THE DON seems preoccupied.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Where's Michael?\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         He'll be here Pop, it's still early.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Then the picture will wait for him.\n\n               Everyone in the group feels the uneasiness as the DON moves \n               back to the house. SONNY gives a delicious smile in the \n               direction of the Maid-of-Honor, LUCY MANCINI. She returns \n               it. Then he moves to his wife.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Sandra, watch the kids. They're \n                         running wild.\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         You watch yourself.\n\n               HAGEN kisses his WIFE, and follows THE DON, passing the wine \n               barrels, where a group of FOUR MEN nervously wait. TOM crooks \n               a finger at NAZORINE, who double checks that he is next, \n               straightens, and follows HAGEN.\n\n\n\n               EXT DAY: MALL ENTRANCE (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               Outside the main gate of the Mall, SEVERAL MEN in suits, \n               working together with a MAN in a dark sedan, walk in and out \n               of the rows of parked cars, writing license plate numbers \n               down in their notebooks. We HEAR the music and laughter coming \n               from the party in the distance.\n\n               A MAN stops at a limousine and copies down the number.\n\n               BARZINI, dignified in a black homburg, is always under the \n               watchful eyes of TWO BODYGUARDS as he makes his way to embrace \n               DON CORLEONE in the courtyard.\n\n               The MEN walk down another row of parked cars. Put another \n               number in the notebook. A shiny new Cadillac with wooden \n               bumpers.\n\n               PETER CLEMENZA, dancing the Tarantella joyously, bumping \n               bellies with the ladies.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         Paulie... wine... WINE.\n\n               He mops his sweating forehead with a big handkerchief. PAULIE \n               hustles, gets a glass of icy black wine, and brings it to \n               him.\n\n                                     PAULIE\n                         You look terrif on the floor!\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         What are you, a dance judge? Go do \n                         your job; take a walk around the \n                         neighborhood... see everything is \n                         okay.\n\n               PAULIE nods and leaves; CLEMENZA takes a breath, and leaps \n               back into the dance.\n\n               The MEN walk down another row of parked cars. Put another \n               number in the notebook.\n\n               TESSIO, a tall, gentle-looking man, dances with a NINE-YEAR- \n               OLD GIRL, her little black party shoes planted on his enormous \n               brown shoes.\n\n               The MEN move on to other parked cars, when SONNY storms out \n               of the gate, his face flushed with anger, followed by CLEMENZA \n               and PAULIE.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Buddy, this is a private party.\n\n               The MAN doesn't answer, but points to the DRIVER of the sedan.  \n               SONNY menacingly thrusts his reddened face at him.\n\n               The DRIVER merely flips open his wallet to a greed card, \n               without saying a word.

One minute.\n\n               HAGEN hesitates. We HEAR LUCY's head bouncing against the \n               door again. TOM leaves.\n\n               INT. DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         ACT LIKE A MAN! By Christ in Heaven, \n                         is it possible you turned out no \n                         better than a Hollywood finocchio.\n\n               Both HAGEN and JOHNNY cannot refrain from laughing. The DON \n               smiles. SONNY enters as noiselessly as possible, still \n               adjusting his clothes.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         All right, Hollywood...

Just a month ago \n                         he bought the movie rights to this \n                         book, a best seller. And the main \n                         character is a guy just like me. I \n                         wouldn't even have to act, just be \n                         myself.\n\n               The DON is silent, stern.\n\n\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         You take care of your family?\n\n                                     JOHNNY\n                         Sure.\n\n               He glances at SONNY, who makes himself as inconspicuous as \n               he can.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         You look terrible. I want you to eat \n                         well, to rest. And spend time with \n                         your family. And then, at the end of \n                         the month, this big shot will give \n                         you the part you want.\n\n                                     JOHNNY\n                         It's too late. All the contracts \n                         have been signed, they're almost \n                         ready to shoot.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         I'll make him an offer he can't \n                         refuse.\n\n               He takes JOHNNY to the door, pinching his cheek hard enough \n               to hurt.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Now go back to the party and leave \n                         it to me.\n\n               He closes the door, smiling to himself. Turns to HAGEN.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         When does my daughter leave with her \n                         bridegroom?\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         They'll cut the cake in a few \n                         minutes... leave right after that.\n                         Your new son-in-law, do we give him \n                         something important?\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         No, give him a living. But never let \n                         him know the family's business. What \n                         else, Tom?\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         I've called the hospital; they've \n                         notified Consiglere Genco's family \n                         to come and wait. He won't last out \n                         the night.\n\n               This saddens the DON. He sighs.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Genco will wait for me.

But \n                         don't leave until I come back from \n                         the hospital and speak to you. \n                         Understood?\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         Understood.\n\n               EXT. DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               Now all the wedding GUESTS excitedly clap their hands over \n               the entrance of the cake: NAZORINE is beaming as he wheels \n               in a serving table containing the biggest, gaudiest, most \n               extravagant wedding cake ever baked, an incredible monument \n               of his gratitude. The CROWD is favorably impressed: they \n               begin to clink their knives or forks against their glasses, \n               in the traditional request for the Bride to cut the cake and \n               kiss the Groom. Louder and louder, five hundred forks hitting \n               five hundred glasses.\n\n               EXT. DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               Silence.\n\n               HIGH ANGLE ON THE MALL, late day. The GUESTS are gone. A \n               single black car is in the courtyard. FREDDIE is behind the \n               driver's seat: the DON enters the car, looks at MICHAEL, who \n               sits between SONNY and JOHNNY in the rear seat.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Will your girl friend get back to \n                         the city all right?\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Tom said he'd take care of it.\n\n               The DON pulls the door shut; and the car pulls out, through \n               the gate of the great Corleone Mall.\n\n               INT. DAY: HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               A long white hospital corridor, at the end of which we can \n               see a grouping of FIVE WOMEN, some old and some young, but \n               all plump and dressed in black.\n\n               DON CORLEONE and his SONS move toward the end. But then the \n               DON slows, putting his hand on MICHAEL's shoulder. MICHAEL \n               stops and turns toward his FATHER. The two looks at one \n               another for some time. SILENCE. DON CORLEONE then lifts his \n               hand, and slowly touches a particular medal on MICHAEL's \n               uniform.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         What was this for?\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         For bravery.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         And this?\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         For killing a man.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         What miracles you do for strangers.\n\n\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         I fought for my country. It was my \n                         choice.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         And now, what do you choose to do?\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         I'm going to finish school.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Good. When you are finished, come \n                         and talk to me. I have hopes for \n                         you.\n\n               Again they regard each other without a word. MICHAEL turns, \n               and continues on. DON CORLEONE watches a moment, and then \n               follows.\n\n               INT. DAY: HOSPITAL ROOM (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               DON CORLEONE enters the hospital room, moving closest to OUR \n               VIEW. He is followed by his SONS, JOHNNY and the WOMEN.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                              (whispered)\n                         Genco, I've brought my sons to pay \n                         their respects. And look, even Johnny \n                         Fontane, all the way from Hollywood.\n\n               GENCO is a tiny, wasted skeleton of a man. DON CORLEONE takes \n               his bony hand, as the others arrange themselves around his \n               bed, each clasping the other hand in turn.\n\n                                     GENCO\n                         Godfather, Godfather, it's your \n                         daughter's wedding day, you cannot \n                         refuse me. Cure me, you have the \n                         power.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         I have no such power... but Genco, \n                         don't fear death.\n\n                                     GENCO\n                              (with a sly wink)\n                         It's been arranged, then?\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         You blaspheme. Resign yourself.\n\n                                     GENCO\n                         You need your old Consigliere. Who \n                         will replace me?\n                              (suddenly)\n                         Stay with me Godfather. Help me meet \n                         death. If he sees you, he will be \n                         frightened and leave me in peace. \n                         You can say a word, pull a few \n                         strings, eh? We'll outwit that bastard \n                         as we outwitted all those others.\n                              (clutching his hand)\n                         Godfather, don't betray me.\n\n               The DON motions all the others to leave the room. They do.\n\n               He returns his attention to GENCO, holding his hand and \n               whispering things we cannot hear, as they wait for death.\n\n\n\n               INT. NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               The interior of a non-stop Constellation. HAGEN is one of \n               the very few passengers on this late flight. He looks like \n               any young lawyer on a business trip. He is tired from the \n               difficult preparation and duties that he has just executed \n               during the wedding. On the seat next to him is an enormous, \n               bulging briefcase. He closes his eyes.\n\n               INT. NIGHT: HONEYMOON HOTEL (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               The honeymoon hotel: CARLO and CONNIE. CARLO is in his \n               undershorts, sitting up on the bed, anxiously taking the \n               envelopes out of the silk bridal purse and counting the \n               contents. CONNIE prepares herself in the large marble \n               bathroom. She rubs her hands over his bronze shoulders, and \n               tries to get his interest.\n\n               INT. NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               DON CORLEONE in his office. LUCA BRASI sitting near to him.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Luca, I am worried about this man \n                         Sollozzo. Find out what you can, \n                         through the Tattaglias. Let them \n                         believe you could be tempted away \n                         from the Corleone Family, if the \n                         right offer was made. Learn what he \n                         has under his fingernails...\n\n               INT. NIGHT: MANCINI APT. HALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               The hallway of an apartment building. SONNY enters, climbs \n               two steps at a time. He knocks, and then whispers.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         It's me, Sonny.\n\n               The door opens, and two lovely arms are around him, pulling \n               him into the apartment.\n\n               INT. NIGHT: LUCA'S ROOM (WINTER 1945)\n\n               LUCA BRASI's tiny room. He is partly dressed. He kneels and \n               reaches under his bed and pulls out a small, locked trunk.  \n               He opens it, and takes out a heavy, bullet-proof vest. He \n               puts it on, over his wool undershirt, and then puts on his \n               shirt and jacket. He takes his gun, quickly disassembles, \n               checks, and reassembles it. And leaves.\n\n               INT. NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               A CLOSE VIEW of DON CORLEONE thinking quietly.\n\n               INT.

NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)\n\n\n\n               HAGEN on the Constellation. He reaches into his briefcase, \n               and takes out several pictures and papers.\n\n               One photograph is of a smiling man, JACK WOLTZ, linked arm \n               in arm with fifteen movie stars on either side, including a \n               lovely young child star to his immediate right.\n\n               HAGEN considers other papers.\n\n               INT. NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               DON CORLEONE looks, and then moves HAGEN into an embrace.  \n               He straightens his arms and looks at TOM deeply.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Remember my new Consigliere, a lawyer \n                         with his briefcase can steal more \n                         than a hundred men with guns.\n\n               EXT. DAY: WOLTZ ESTATE GATE (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               JACK WOLTZ ESTATE. HAGEN stands before the impressive gate, \n               armed only with his briefcase. A GATEMAN opens the gate, and \n               TOM enters.\n\n               EXT. DAY: WOLTZ GARDENS (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               HAGEN and WOLTZ comfortably stroll along beautiful formal \n               gardens, martinis in hand.\n\n                                     WOLTZ\n                         You should have told me your boss \n                         was Corleone, Tom, I had to check \n                         you out. I thought you were just \n                         some third rate hustler Johnny was \n                         running in to bluff me.\n                              (a piece of statuary)\n                         Florence, thirteenth century.\n                         Decorated the garden of a king.\n\n               They cross the garden and head toward the stables.\n\n                                     WOLTZ\n                         I'm going to show you something \n                         beautiful.\n\n               They pass the stables, and come to rest by a stall with a \n               huge bronze plaque attached to the outside wall: \"KHARTOUM.\" \n               TWO SECURITY GUARDS are positioned in chairs nearby; they \n               rise as WOLTZ approaches.\n\n                                     WOLTZ\n                         You like horses? I like horses, I \n                         love 'em. Beautiful, expensive \n                         Racehorses.\n\n               The animal inside is truly beautiful. WOLTZ whispers to him \n               with true love in his voice.\n\n                                     WOLTZ\n                         Khartoum... Kartoum... You are looking \n                         at six hundred thousand dollars on \n                         four hoofs. I bet even Russian Czars \n                         never paid that kind of dough for a \n                         single horse. But I'm not going to \n                         race him I'm going to put him out to \n                         Stud.\n\n\n\n               INT. NIGHT: WOLTZ DINING ROOM (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               HAGEN and WOLTZ sit at an enormous dining room table, attended \n               by SEVERAL SERVANTS. Great paintings hang on the walls. The \n               meal is elaborate and sumptuous.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather.\n\n               That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship.\n\n                                     WOLTZ\n                         Okay, but just tell him this is one \n                         favor I can't give. But he should \n                         try me again on anything else.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         He never asks a second favor when he \n                         has been refused the first. \n                         Understood?\n\n                                     WOLTZ\n                         You smooth son of a bitch, let me \n                         lay it on the line for you, and your \n                         boss. Johnny Fontane never gets that \n                         movie. I don't care how many Dago, \n                         Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come \n                         out of the woodwork!\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         I'm German-Irish.\n\n                                     WOLTZ\n                         Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny \n                         will never get that part because I \n                         hate that pinko punk and I'm going \n                         to run him out of the Movies. And \n                         I'll tell you why. He ruined one of \n                         Woltz Brothers' most valuable \n                         proteges. For five years I had this \n                         girl under training; singing lessons!  \n                         Acting lessons! Dancing lessons! We \n                         spent hundreds of thousands of dollars--\n                         I was going to make her a star. I'll \n                         be even more frank, just to show you \n                         that I'm not a hard-hearted man, \n                         that it wasn't all dollars and cents. \n                         That girl was beautiful and young \n                         and innocent and she was the greatest \n                         piece of ass I've ever had and I've \n                         had them all over the world. Then \n                         Johnny comes along with that olive \n                         oil voice and guinea charm and she \n                         runs off. She threw it all away to \n                         make me look ridiculous. A MAN IN MY \n                         POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE MADE TO \n                         LOOK RIDICULOUS!\n\n               EXT. DAY: GENCO OLIVE OIL CO. (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               An unimposing little building in New York City on Mott Street \n               with a large old sign: \"GENCO OLIVE OIL IMPORTS, INC.\" next \n               to an open-faced fruit market.\n\n               A dark Buick pulls up, and a single small man, whom we cannot \n               see well because of the distance, gets out and enters the \n               building. This is VIRGIL SOLLOZZO.\n\n               INT. DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)\n\n\n\n               Looking toward the staircase we can hear SOLLOZZO's footsteps \n               before he actually rises into view. He is a small man, very \n               dark, with curly black hair. But wiry, and tight and hard, \n               and obviously very dangerous. He is greeted at the head of \n               the stairs by SONNY, who takes his hand and shakes it, \n               introducing himself. For a moment, there is a complex of \n               handshaking quite formal, and whispered respectful \n               introductions. Finally, SOLLOZZO is taken into the DON's \n               glass paneled office; the two principals are introduced.  \n               They are very respectful of one another. Folding chairs are \n               brought in by FREDDIE, and soon they are all sitting around \n               in a circle; the DON, SOLLOZZO, SONNY, HAGEN, FREDDIE, \n               CLEMENZA and TESSIO. The DON is the slightest bit foolish \n               with all his compatriots, whereas SOLLOZZO has brought no \n               one. Throughout all that transpires, however, it is clear \n               that this scene is between two men: SOLLOZZO and DON CORLEONE.\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         My business is heroin, I have poppy \n                         fields, laboratories in Narseilles \n                         and Sicily, ready to go into \n                         production. My importing methods are \n                         as safe as these things can be, about \n                         five per cent loss. The risk is \n                         nothing, the profits enormous.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Why do you come to me? Why do I \n                         deserve your generosity?\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         I need two million dollars in cash... \n                         more important, I need a friend who \n                         has people in high places; a friend \n                         who can guarantee that if one of my \n                         employees be arrested, they would \n                         get only light sentences. Be my \n                         friend.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         What percentages for my family?\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         Thirty per cent. In the first year \n                         your share would be four million \n                         dollars; then it would go up.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         And what is the percentage of the \n                         Tattaglia family?\n\n               SOLLOZZO nods toward HAGEN.\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         My compliments. I'll take care of \n                         them from my share.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         So. I receive 30 per cent just for \n                         finance and legal protection. No \n                         worries about operations, is that \n                         what you tell me?\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         If you think two million dollars in \n                         cash is just finance, I congratulate \n                         you Don Corleone.\n\n\n\n               There is a long silence; in which each person present feels \n               the tension. The DON is about to give his answer.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         I said I would see you because I've \n                         heard you're a serious man, to be \n                         treated with respect...\n                              (pause)\n                         But I'll say no to you.\n\n               We feel this around the room.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         I'll give you my reasons. I have \n                         many, many friends in Politics.\n                         But they wouldn't be so friendly if \n                         my business was narcotics instead of \n                         gambling. They think gambling is \n                         something like liquor, a harmless \n                         vice... and they think narcotics is \n                         dirty business.\n\n               SOLLOZZO takes a breath.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         No... how a man makes his living is \n                         none of my business. But this \n                         proposition of yours is too risky.\n                         All the people in my family lived \n                         well the last ten years, I won't \n                         risk that out of greed.\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         Are you worried about security for \n                         your million?\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         No.\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         The Tattaglias will guarantee your \n                         investment also.\n\n               This startles SONNY; he blurts out.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         The Tattaglia family guarantees our \n                         investment?\n\n               SOLLOZZO hears him first, and then very slowly turns to face \n               him. Everyone is the room knows that SONNY has stepped out \n               of line.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Young people are greedy, and they \n                         have no manners. They speak when \n                         they should listen. But I have a \n                         sentimental weakness for my children, \n                         and I've spoiled them, as you see.  \n                         But Signor Sollozzo, my no is final.\n\n               SOLLOZZO nods, understands that this is the dismissal. He \n               glances one last time at SONNY. He rises; all the others do \n               as well. He bows to the DON, shakes his hand, and formally \n               takes his leave. When the footsteps can no longer be heard:\n\n               The DON turns to SONNY.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n\n\n\n                         Santino, never let anyone outside \n                         the family know what you are thinking.  \n                         I think your brain is going soft \n                         from all that comedy you play with \n                         that young girl.\n\n               TWO OFFICE WORKERS are carrying an enormous floral display \n               with the word \"THANK YOU\" spelled out in flowers.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         What is this nonsense?\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         It's from Johnny. It was announced \n                         this morning. He's going to play the \n                         lead in the new Woltz Brothers film.\n\n               INT. DAY: WOLTZ'S BEDROOM (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               It is large, dominated by a huge bed, in which a man, \n               presumably WOLTZ, is sleeping. Soft light bathes the room \n               from the large windows. We move closer to him until we see \n               his face, and recognize JACK WOLTZ. He turns uncomfortably; \n               mutters, feels something strange in his bedsheets.

He is frightened, \n               pulls aside the covers, and sees fresh blood on his sheets \n               and pajamas. He grunts, pulls the puddle of blood in his \n               bed. He feels his own body frantically, moving, down, \n               following the blood, until he is face to face with the great \n               severed head of Khartoum lying at the foot of his bed. Just \n               blood from the hacked neck. White reedy tendons show. He \n               struggles up to his elbows in the puddle of blood to see \n               more clearly. Froth covers the muzzle, and the enormous eyes \n               of the animal are yellowed and covered with blood.\n\n               WOLTZ tries to scream; but cannot. No sound comes out.\n\n               Then, finally and suddenly an ear-splitting scream of pure \n               terror escapes from WOLTZ, who is rocking on his hands and \n               knees in an uncontrolled fit, blood all over him.\n\n               INT.

When \n               FREDDIE sees his FATHER coming, he moves back into the \n               driver's seat. The DON moves to the car, and is about to get \n               in when he hesitates, and turns back to the long, open fruit \n               stand near the corner.\n\n               The PROPRIETOR springs to serve him. The DON walks among the \n               trays and baskets, and merely points to a particular piece \n               of fruit. As he selects, the MAN gingerly picks the pieces \n               of fruit up and puts them into a paper bag.

He rushes out, a gun trembling \n               in his hand; his mouth open. He actually drops the gun.\n\n               The gun falls amid the rolling fruit.\n\n               The GUNMEN are panicked. They fire once more at the downed \n               DON CORLEONE. His leg and arm twitch where they are hit; and \n               pools of blood are beginning to form.\n\n               The GUNMEN are obviously in a state of panic and confusion; \n               they disappear around the corner as quickly as they came.\n\n               The PEOPLE about the avenue have all but disappeared: rather, \n               we catch glimpses of them, poking their heads safely from \n               around corners, inside doorways and arches, and from windows.  \n               But the street itself is now empty.\n\n               FREDDIE is in shock; he looks at his FATHER; now great puddles \n               of blood have formed, and the DON is lifeless and face down \n               in them.\n\n               FREDDIE falls back on to the curb and sits there, saying \n               something we cannot understand. He begins to weep profusely.\n\n               INT. NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)\n\n               LUCA BRASI riding alone on a subway car, late at night. He \n               gets off.\n\n               He emerges at a subway terminal, proceeds out.\n\n               EXT. NITE: NIGHT CLUB STREET (WINTER 1945)\n\n               LUCA walks down the late night street. He approaches an \n               elegant New York Nightclub, whose gaudy neon sign is still \n               winking this late at night. He waits and watches. Then the \n               sign goes out; and he proceeds into the club.\n\n               INT. NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)\n\n               The main floor of the Nightclub is very large, with endless \n               glistening wooden floors. Now, at this late time, the chairs \n               have been stacked on the tables and a NEGRO JANITOR is waxing \n               them. A single HAT-CHECK GIRL is counting her receipts. LUCA \n               moves past the empty bandstand, and sits at the bar. ANOTHER \n               MAN, dark and very well-built, moves behind the bar.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Luca...

I've heard \n                         you're not happy with your family, \n                         you might make a switch.\n\n                                     LUCA\n                         If the money is good enough.\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         On the first shipment, I can guarantee \n                         you fifty thousand dollars.\n\n               LUCA looks at him; he had no idea the offer would be so good.\n\n               SOLLOZZO extends his hand, but LUCA pretends not to see it, \n               rather, he busies himself putting a cigarette in his mouth.  \n               BRUNO TATTAGLIA, behind the bar, makes a cigarette lighter \n               magically appear, and holds it to LUCA's cigarette. Then, he \n               does an odd thing; he drops the lighter on the bar, and puts \n               his hand lightly on LUCA's, almost patting it.\n\n               INT. NITE: SONNY'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)\n\n               The telephone in SONNY's house is ringing. He approaches it, \n               obviously fresh from a nap.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Yeah.\n\n                                     VOICE (O.S.)\n                         Do you recognize my voice?\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         I think so.

There's a lot of blood. I'll \n                         try to find out more.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Find out anything you can... you got \n                         a Grand coming.\n                              (click)\n\n               SONNY cradles the phone. An incredible rage builds up in \n               him, his face actually turning red. He would like to rip the \n               phone to pieces in his bare hands. Then he controls it.\n\n               Quickly, he dials another number.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Theresa, let me talk to Tom.

Nothing else \n                         is going to happen.\n\n               There is a POUNDING on the door. A BABY starts crying.\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                              (really frightened)\n                         SONNY?\n\n               SONNY reaches into a cabinet drawer, takes out a gun, and \n               moves quickly. He opens the front door quickly. It is \n               CLEMENZA. He enters, SONNY closes the door. SANDRA goes to \n               look after the baby.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                              (excited)\n                         You heard about your father?\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Yeah.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         The word is out in the streets that \n                         he's dead.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't \n                         he with the Don?\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         Paulie's been a little sick all \n                         winter... he was home.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         How many times did he stay home the \n                         last couple of months?\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         Maybe three, four times. I always \n                         asked Freddie if he wanted another \n                         bodyguard, but he said no.

Pick him up yourself, and \n                         bring him to my father's house.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         That's all? Don't you want me to \n                         send some people over here?\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         No, just you and Paulie.\n\n               CLEMENZA leaves; SONNY moves to SANDRA, who sits on the couch \n\n\n\n               weeping quietly, comforting her BABY.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         A couple of our people will come to \n                         stay here.

NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)\n\n               FULL VIEW OF THE CORLEONE MALL. It is night, but the courtyard \n               is bathed with white light from floodlights on the tops of \n               all the houses. It is very cold. We see the figure of SONNY \n               cross the Mall, and let himself into the main house.\n\n               INT. NITE: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)\n\n               SONNY walks into the empty, darkened house. Then he calls \n               out.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Ma? Ma, where are you.\n\n               The kitchen door swings open. He moves quickly and takes her \n               by the arm. He is deliberately calm.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Ma, I just got a call. Pop's hurt... \n                         I don't know how bad.\n\n                                     MAMA\n                              (quietly)\n                         Santino? Have they killed him?\n\n                                     SONNY\n                              (almost in tears)\n                         We don't know yet, Ma.\n\n                                     MAMA\n                         I'll get dressed. In case we can see \n\n\n\n                         him...\n\n               She moves out of the kitchen, and continues upstairs. SONNY \n               turns the gas from the pan of peppers she was frying. He \n               takes some bread without thinking, and dips it in the oil, \n               and sloppily eats some of the peppers, as he moves into his \n               father's office.\n\n               INT. NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\n\n               He switches the lights on in the DON's office. The massive \n               desk dominates the room. SONNY moves quickly to the telephone, \n               pulling a small chair to the side of the desk, and dials a \n               number.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Tessio... This is Santino Corleone. \n                         I want fifty reliable men out here.\n\n                                     TESSIO (O.S.)\n                         I heard, Sonny... but what about \n                         Clemenza's regime?\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         I don't want to use Clemenza's people \n                         right now. Understood?\n\n               He hangs up. He moves quickly to a wall safe; operates the \n               dial, and removes a small notebook. He takes it back to the \n               desk, and runs over the list of numbers with his forefinger.  \n               We follow the names, until the finger stops at one: LUCA \n               BRASI. SONNY dials the number. There is no answer.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Luca.\n\n               INT. NITE: BUILDING (WINTER 1945)\n\n               The interior of an abandoned building. SEVERAL MEN in suits \n               and ties sit around in the booths.\n\n               HAGEN sits in one: SOLLOZZO sits across from him.\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         I know you're not in the muscle end \n                         of the family--so I don't want you \n                         to be afraid.

He can hear the phone ringing on the other end \n               but no one answers.

BRUNO TATTAGLIA had just patted his hand.  \n               LUCA looks up at him.\n\n               Then SOLLOZZO pats the other hand, almost affectionately.\n\n               LUCA is just about to twist his hands away, when they both \n               clamp down as hard as they can. Suddenly, a garrote is thrown \n               around his neck, and pulled violently tight. His face begins \n               to turn to purple blotches, and then totally purple, right \n               before our eyes; his tongue hangs out, in a far more extreme \n               way than a normal tongue could. His eyes bulge.\n\n               ONE of the MEN looks down at him in disgust as LUCA's strength \n               leaves him.\n\n                                     BRUNO\n                              (making an ugly face)\n                         Oh Christ... all over the floor.\n\n\n\n               SOLLOZZO lets LUCA's hand go with a victorious smile on his \n               face.\n\n               LUCA falls to the floor.\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         The Godfather is next.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               EXT. DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)\n\n               Morning in a simple Brooklyn suburb. There are rows of \n               pleasant houses; driveway after driveway, down the block. A \n               dark, somber young man of thirty-one or two walks with a \n               noticeable limp down the sidewalk, and rings the bell. This \n               is ROCCO LAMPONE. The woman of the house, MRS. CLEMENZA, \n               talks to him through the screen door, and then points to the \n               side of the house. ROCCO moves to the garage, which is \n               specially heated, and in which CLEMENZA is busy at work \n               washing a shiny brand new Lincoln. LAMPONE admires the car.\n\n                                     LAMPONE\n                         Nice.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         Crazy Detroit delivered it with a \n                         wooden bumper. They're going to send \n                         me the chrome bumpers in a couple \n                         months. I waited two years for this \n                         car to come with wooden bumpers!\n\n               He scrubs and polishes with great affection.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         Today you make your bones on Paulie.\n                         You understand everything?\n\n                                     LAMPONE\n                         Sure.\n\n               As he scrubs around the glove compartment, he opens it, \n               unwraps a gun and gives it to LAMPONE.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         .22 soft-nosed load. Accurate up to \n                         five feet.\n\n               LAMPONE expertly puts the gun away. GATTO's car pulls into \n               the driveway, and he sounds the horn.\n\n               The two men walk to the car. GATTO is driving, a bit nervous, \n               like he doesn't know what is up. LAMPONE gets in the rear \n               seat; CLEMENZA in the front, making a grunt of recognition.  \n               He looks at his wristwatch, as though wanting to chide PAULIE \n               for being late. PAULIE flinches a little when he sees LAMPONE \n               will ride behind him; he half turns:\n\n                                     PAULIE\n                         Rocco, sit on the other side.

He's running scared.\n                         He's already thinking of going to \n                         the mattresses. We have to find a \n                         place on the West Side. Paulie, you \n                         know a good location?\n\n               PAULIE relaxes a bit; he thinks he's off any possible hook \n               he was on. Also there's the money he can make by selling \n               Sollozzo any secret location.\n\n                                     PAULIE\n                         I'll think about it.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                              (grunting)\n                         Drive while you thinking; I wanna \n                         get to the City this month!\n\n               The car pulls out.\n\n               EXT. DAY: PAULIE'S CAR - ON ROAD (WINTER 1945)\n\n               Inside PAULIE drives; and CLEMENZA sits in a grump. OUR VIEW \n               does not show LAMPONE in the rear seat.\n\n               EXT.

DAY: PAULIE'S CAR IN TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)\n\n               Inside the tunnel; GATTO doesn't like not seeing LAMPONE.\n\n               He tries to adjust his rearview mirror to catch a glimpse of \n               him.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         Pay attention!\n\n               EXT. DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)\n\n               The car is parked in the City. PAULIE comes down from an \n               available apartment and gets back into the car.\n\n                                     PAULIE\n                         Good for ten men...\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose \n                         to call when I found somethin'.\n\n               The car pulls off.\n\n               EXT.

DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)\n\n               CLEMENZA enters the little restaurant, sits down at a table.  \n\n\n\n               The WAITERS know him; immediately put a bottle of wine, some \n               bread--and then a plate of veal on his table. He eats.\n\n               EXT. DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)\n\n               CLEMENZA exits the restaurant, belches, adjusts his pants; \n               he is well fed.\n\n               We move with him around the corner, not knowing what to expect \n               has happened to Paulie.\n\n               There is the car; PAULIE is still sitting behind the wheel, \n               LAMPONE in the rear seat. CLEMENZA steps in.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         He talked my ear off. Want us to go \n                         back to Long Beach; have another job \n                         for us. Rocco, you live in the City, \n                         can we drop you off?\n\n                                     LAMPONE (O.S.)\n                         Ah, I left my car at your place.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         OK, then you gotta come back.\n\n               The car pulls out. By now, PAULIE is completely relaxed and \n               secure.\n\n                                     PAULIE\n                         You think we'll go for that last \n                         place?\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         Maybe, or you gotta know now.\n\n                                     PAULIE\n                         Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.\n\n               EXT. DAY: PAULIE'S CAR ON CAUSEWAY (WINTER 1945)\n\n               The car moves along the ready beach area of the causeway.\n\n               Inside, CLEMENZA turns to PAULIE.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         Paulie, pull over. I gotta take a \n                         leak.\n\n               The car pulls off the Causeway, into the reeds. CLEMENZA \n               steps out of the car, OUR VIEW MOVING with him.\n\n               He turns his back three quarters from us (we can no longer \n               see the car), unzips, and we hear the sound of urine hitting \n               the ground. We wait on this for a moment; and then there are \n               two GUNSHOTS. CLEMENZA finishes his leak, zips up and turns, \n               moving back to the car.\n\n               PAULIE is dead, bleeding from the mouth; the windows behind \n               him are shattered.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         Leave the gun.\n\n               LAMPONE gets out, the two men walk through the reeds a few \n               feet where there is another car. They get in, and drive off.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n\n\n               EXT. DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)\n\n               HIGH ANGLE OF THE MALL. It is late afternoon. Many strange \n               cars are parked on the nearby streets. We can see the group \n               of BUTTON MEN, stationed here and there, obviously sentries \n               with concealed weapons.\n\n               MICHAEL walks along in the rear yard.\n\n               He is bundled in a warm marine coat. He looks at the strange \n               men, regarding them with an uncertain awe. They look back at \n               him, at first suspiciously and then with the respect of his \n               position. He is like an exile Prince. He wanders past them, \n               and hesitates and looks at the yard.\n\n               A rusted set of garden swings; and other home playground \n               equipment. The basketball ring now half coming off. This is \n               where he was a child. Then a shout.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA (O.S.)\n                         Mike. Hey Mikey; telephone.\n\n               CLEMENZA had shouted from the kitchen window. MICHAEL hurries \n               into the house.\n\n               INT. DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)\n\n               CLEMENZA is in the kitchen, cooking over an enormous pot.  \n               He points to the kitchen wall phone which is hanging off the \n               hook.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         Some dame.\n\n               MICHAEL picks it up.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Hello.

He curls \n               up in a corner, and in a quarter voice:\n\n\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         I can't...\n\n                                     KAY (O.S.)\n                         Please say it.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Look.

NITE: CAR\n\n               MICHAEL sits in the rear seat, calmly, as he is being driven \n               into the city.

NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)\n\n               A taxi pulls up in front of a hospital, marked clearly with \n               a neon sign \"HOSPITAL--EMERGENCY.\" MICHAEL steps out, pays \n               the fare... and then stops dead in his tracks.\n\n               MICHAEL looks.\n\n               He sees the hospital in the night; but it is deserted. He is \n               the only one on the street. There are gay, twinkling Christmas \n               decorations all over the building. He walks, slowly at first, \n               and then ever so quickly, up the steps. He hesitates, looks \n               around. This area is empty. He checks the address on a scrap \n               of paper. It is correct. He tries the door, it is empty.\n\n\n\n               He walks in.\n\n               INT. NITE: HOSPITAL LOBBY (WINTER 1945)\n\n               MICHAEL stands in the center of an absolutely empty hospital \n               lobby. He looks to the right; there is a long, empty corridor.  \n               To the left: the same.\n\n               HIGH FULL ANGLE, as MICHAEL walks through the desolated \n               building lit by eerie green neon lighting. All we hear are \n               his sole footsteps.\n\n               He walks up to a desk marked \"INFORMATION\". No one is there.  \n               He moves quickly to a door marked \"OFFICE\"; swings into it; \n               no one is there. He looks onto the desk: There is half a \n               sandwich, and a half-filled bottle of coke.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Hello? Hello?\n\n               Now he knows something is happening, he moves quickly, \n               alertly. MICHAEL walking down the hospital corridors; all \n               alone. The floors have just been mopped. They are still wet.\n\n               INT NITE: HOSPITAL STAIRS\n\n               Now he turns onto a staircase; ever quickening; up several \n               flights.\n\n               INT. NITE: 4TH FLOOR CORRIDOR\n\n               He steps out onto the fourth floor. He looks. There are merely \n               empty corridors. He takes out his scrap of paper; checks it.  \n               \"Room 4A.\" Now he hurries, trying to follow the code of \n               hospital rooms; following the right arrows, quicker and \n               quicker they flash by him. Now he stops, looks up \"4A-- \n               Corleone\".\n\n               There is a special card table set up there with some \n               magazines... and some smoking cigarettes still in the ashtray--\n               but no detectives, no police, no bodyguards.\n\n               INT. NITE: DON'S ROOM\n\n               Slowly he pushes the door open, almost afraid at what he \n               will find. He looks. Lit by the moonlight through the window, \n               he can see a FIGURE in the hospital bed alone in the room, \n               and under a transparent oxygen tent. All that can be heard \n               is the steady though strained breathing. Slowly MICHAEL walks \n               up to it, and is relieved to see his FATHER, securely asleep.  \n               Tubes hang from a steel gallows beside the bed, and run to \n               his nose and mouth.\n\n                                     VOICE (O.S.)\n                         What are you doing here?\n\n               This startles MICHAEL; who almost jumps around. It is a NURSE \n               lit from the light behind her in the hallway.\n\n                                     NURSE\n                         You're not supposed to be here now.\n\n               MICHAEL calms himself, and moves to her.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         I'm Michael Corleone--this is my \n                         father. What happened to the \n                         detectives who were guarding him?\n\n\n\n                                     NURSE\n                         Oh your father just had too many \n                         visitors. It interfered with the \n                         hospital service. The police came \n                         and made them all leave just ten \n                         minutes ago.\n                              (comfortingly)\n                         But don't worry.

None of \n                         Tessio's people--no detectives, no \n                         one.

You've seen that no one's \n                         here to guard him. Now I've just \n                         gotten word that men are coming to \n                         this hospital to kill him.

NITE: 4TH FLOOR HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)\n\n\n\n               They roll the bed, the stand, and all the tubes silently \n               down the corridor. We hear FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs.  \n               MICHAEL hears them, stops.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Hurry, into there.\n\n               They push it into the first available room. MICHAEL peeks \n               out from the door. The footsteps are louder; then they emerge.  \n               It is ENZO, NAZORINE's helper, carrying a bouquet of flowers.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                              (stepping out)\n                         Who is it?\n\n                                     ENZO\n                         Michael... do you remember me, Enzo, \n                         the baker's helper to Nazorine, now \n                         his son-in-law.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Enzo, get out of here. There's going \n                         to be trouble.\n\n               A look of fear sweeps through ENZO's face.\n\n                                     ENZO\n                         If there... will be trouble...

MICHAEL moves into the hospital room where they \n               put his FATHER.\n\n                                     NURSE\n                              (frightened)\n                         He's awake.\n\n               MICHAEL looks at the OLD MAN, his eyes are open, though he \n               cannot speak. MICHAEL touches his face tenderly.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Pop... Pop, it's me Michael. Shhhh, \n                         don't try to speak. There are men \n                         who are coming to try to kill you.\n                         But I'm with you... I'm with you \n                         now...\n\n               The OLD MAN tries to speak...but cannot. MICHAEL tenderly \n               puts his finger to his FATHER's lips.\n\n               EXT. NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL STREET (WINTER 1945)\n\n               Outside the hospital is empty save for a nervous ENZO, pacing \n               back and forth brandishly the flowers as his only weapon.  \n               MICHAEL exits the hospital and moves to him. They both stand \n               under a lamppost in the cold December night. They are both \n               frightened; MICHAEL gives ENZO a cigarette, lights it. ENZO's \n               hands are trembling, MICHAEL's are not.\n\n\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Get rid of those and look like you've \n                         got a gun in your pocket.\n\n               The windows of the hospital twinkle with Christmas \n               decorations.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Listen...\n\n               We HEAR the sound of a single automobile coming. MICHAEL and \n               ENZO look with fear in their eyes. Then MICHAEL takes the \n               bouquet of flowers and stuffs them under his jacket.\n\n               They stand, hands in their pockets.\n\n               A long low black car turns the corner and cruises by them.\n\n               MICHAEL's and ENZO's faces are tough, impassive. The car \n               seems as though it will stop; and then quickly accelerates.\n\n               MICHAEL and ENZO are relieved. MICHAEL looks down; the BAKER's \n               hands are shaking. He looks at his own, and they are not.\n\n               Another moment goes by and we can hear the distant sound of \n               police sirens. They are clearly coming toward the hospital, \n               getting louder and louder. MICHAEL heaves a sigh of relief.\n\n               In a second, a patrol car makes a screaming turn in front of \n               the hospital; then two more squad cars follow with uniformed \n               POLICE and DETECTIVES. He smiles his relief and starts toward \n               them. TWO huge, burly POLICEMEN suddenly grab his arms while \n               ANOTHER frisks him. A massive POLICE CAPTAIN, spattered with \n               gold braid and scrambled eggs on his hat, with beefy red \n               face and white hair seems furious. This is McCLUSKEY.\n\n                                     MCCLUSKEY\n                         I thought I got all you guinea hoods \n                         locked up.

MICHAEL \n               groans, and lifts his hand to his jaw. He looks at McCLUSKEY; \n               we are his VIEW and everything goes spinning, and he falls \n               to the ground, just as we see HAGEN and CLEMENZA'S MEN arrive.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               EXT.

There are more BUTTON MEN \n               stationed more formally; and some of them visibly carrying \n               rifles; those of the houses close to the courtyard have MEN \n               standing by open windows. It is clear that the war is \n               escalating. A car pulls up and out get CLEMENZA, LAMPONE, \n               MICHAEL and HAGEN. MICHAEL's jaw is wired and bandaged.

What you \n                         have to understand is that while \n                         Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's \n                         invulnerable. Nobody has ever gunned \n                         down a New York Police Captain. Never. \n                         It would be disastrous. All the five \n                         families would come after you Sonny; \n                         the Corleone family would be outcasts; \n                         even the old man's political \n                         protection would run for cover. So \n                         just... take that into consideration.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                              (still fuming)\n                         McCluskey can't stay with the Turk \n                         forever.

Perfect.\n                              (he moves to the desk \n                              and makes a crude \n                              drawing)\n                         This is the entrance, Mike. When you \n                         finish just walk out and turn left, \n                         then turn the corner. Clemenza, you \n                         gotta work fast to plant the gun.  \n                         They got an old-fashioned toilet \n                         with a space between the water \n                         container and the wall. We can tape \n                         the gun behind there.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         Mike, they're gonna frisk you in the \n                         car. You'll be clean so they won't \n                         worry 'bout nothing. In the \n                         restaurant, wait and talk a while, \n                         and then ask permission to go. See?\n                         Then when you come out, don't waste \n                         time; don't sit down... you come out \n                         blasting. And don't take chances. In \n                         the head, two shots apiece. And out \n                         as fast as your legs can move.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         I want somebody very good, very safe \n                         to plant that gun. I don't want my \n                         brother coming out of that toilet \n                         with just his dick in his hand.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         The gun will be there.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                              (to MICHAEL, warmly)\n                         You're on, kid... I'll square it \n                         with Mom your not seeing her before \n                         you left. And I'll get a message to \n                         your girl friend when I think the \n                         time is right.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         We gotta move...\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         O.K. How long do you think before I \n                         can come back?\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Probably a year...\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                              (starting to crack)\n                         Jesus, I don't know...\n\n\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Can you do it Mike?\n\n               MICHAEL moves out.\n\n               EXT. NITE: CAMELS SIGN (WINTER 1945)\n\n               The enormous \"CAMELS\" sign, puffing smoke, below it stands \n               MICHAEL, dressed in a warm overcoat, and wearing the hat \n               CLEMENZA had given him. A long black car pulls around the \n               corner and slows before him. The DRIVER, leaning over, open \n               the front door.\n\n                                     DRIVER\n                         Get in, Mike.\n\n               He does, the car drives off.\n\n               EXT. NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)\n\n               Inside the car, SOLLOZZO reaches his hand over the back seat \n               and shakes MIKE's hand.\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         I'm glad you came, Mike. I hope we \n                         can straighten everything out. All \n                         this is terrible, it's not the way I \n                         wanted things to happen at all. It \n                         should never have happened.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         I want to settle things tonight. I \n                         want my father left alone.\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         He won't be; I swear to you be my \n                         children he won't be. Just keep an \n                         open mind when we talk. I hope you're \n                         not a hothead like your brother, \n                         Sonny. It's impossible to talk \n                         business with him.\n\n               McCLUSKEY grunts.\n\n                                     MCCLUSKEY\n                         He's a good kid. He's all right. \n                         Turn around, up on your knees, facing \n                         me.\n\n               He gives MICHAEL a thorough frisk.\n\n                                     MCCLUSKEY\n                         I'm sorry about the other night Mike.  \n                         I'm getting too old for my job, too \n                         grouchy. Can't stand the aggravation.  \n                         You know how it is. He's clean.\n\n               EXT. NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR - WEST SIDE HIGHWAY (WINTER 1945)\n\n               MICHAEL looks at the DRIVER and then ahead to see where \n               they're heading.\n\n               The car takes the George Washington Bridge. MICHAEL is \n               concerned.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         We're going to New Jersey?\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n\n\n\n                              (sly)\n                         Maybe.\n\n               MICHAEL closes his eyes.\n\n               EXT. NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR ON G.W. BRIDGE (WINTER 1945)\n\n               The car speeds along the George Washington Bridge on its way \n               to New Jersey. Then suddenly it hits the divider, temporarily \n               lifts into the air, and bounces over into the lanes going \n               back to New York. It then hits it very fast, on the way back \n               to the city.\n\n               EXT. NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)\n\n               SOLLOZZO checks to see the cars that had been following, and \n               then leans to the DRIVER.\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         Nice work; I'll remember it.\n\n               MICHAEL is relieved.\n\n               EXT. NITE: LUNA AZURA RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)\n\n               The car pulls up in front of a little family restaurant in \n               the Bronx: The \"LUNA AZURA\". There is no one on the street. \n               MICHAEL looks to see if the DRIVER is going to get out with \n               them. He gets out, and opens the door. SOLLOZZO, McCLUSKEY \n               and MICHAEL get out; the DRIVER remains leaning against the \n               car. They enter the restaurant.\n\n               INT. NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)\n\n               A very small family restaurant with a mosaic tile floor.  \n               SOLLOZZO, MICHAEL and McCLUSKEY sit around a rather small \n               round table near the center of the room. There are empty \n               booths along the side walls; with a handful of CUSTOMERS, \n               and ONE or TWO WAITERS. It is very quiet.\n\n                                     MCCLUSKEY\n                         Is the Italian food good here?\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         Try the veal; it's the finest in New \n                         York.\n\n               The solitary WAITER brings a bottle of wine to the table.\n\n               They watch him silently as he uncorks it and pours three \n               glasses. Then, when he leaves, SOLLOZZO turns to McCLUSKEY:\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         I am going to talk Italian to Mike.\n\n                                     MCCLUSKEY\n                         Sure, you two go right ahead; I'll \n                         concentrate on my veal and my \n                         spaghetti.\n\n               SOLLOZZO now begins in rapid Sicilian. MICHAEL listening \n               carefully and nodding every so often. Then MICHAEL answers \n               in Sicilian, and SOLLOZZO goes on. The WAITER occasionally \n               brings food; and they hesitate while he is there; then go \n               on.\n\n               Then MICHAEL, having difficulty expressing himself in Italian, \n               accidentally lapses into English.\n\n\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                              (using English for \n                              emphasis)\n                         Most important... I want a sure \n                         guarantee that no more attempts will \n                         be made on my father's life.\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         What guarantees can I give you? I am \n                         the hunted one. I've missed my chance.  \n                         You think too highly of me, my \n                         friend... I am not so clever... all \n                         I want is a truce...\n\n               MICHAEL looks long and hard at SOLLOZZO, who is smiling \n               holding his open hands up as if to say: \"I have no tricks up \n               my sleeve\". Then he looks away and makes a distressed look \n               on his face.\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         What is it?\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Is it all right if I go to the \n                         bathroom?\n\n               SOLLOZZO is intuitively suspicious. He studies MICHAEL with \n               his dark eyes. Then he thrusts his hand onto MICHAEL's thigh \n               feeling in and around, searching for a weapon.\n\n                                     MCCLUSKEY\n                         I frisked him; I've frisked thousands \n                         of young punks; he's clean.\n\n               He looks at a MAN sitting at a table opposite them; indicating \n               the bathroom with his eyes. The MAN nods, indicating no one \n               is there.\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         Don't take too long.\n\n               MICHAEL gets up and calmly walks to the bathroom, and \n               disappears inside.\n\n               INT. NITE: LUNA AZURA TOILET (WINTER 1945)\n\n               MICHAEL steps into the small bathroom; he is breathing very \n               hard. He actually uses the urinal. Then he washes his hands \n               with the bar of pink soap; and dries them thoroughly. Then \n               he moves to the booth, up to the old-fashioned toilet.\n\n               Slowly he reaches behind the water tank; he panics when he \n               cannot feel the gun. We see behind the tank his hand is just \n               a few inches from the gun... he gropes searchingly... finally \n               coming to rest on the gun.\n\n               CLOSE ON MICHAEL; the feel of it reassures him. Then he breaks \n               it loose from the tape holding it; he takes a deep breath \n               and shoves it under his waistband. For some unexplainable \n               reason he hesitates once again, deliberately washes his hands \n               and dries them. Then he goes out.\n\n               INT. NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)\n\n               He hesitates by the bathroom door; and looks at his table.\n\n               McCLUSKEY is eating a plate of spaghetti and veal. SOLLOZZO \n               turns around upon hearing the door, and looks directly at \n               MICHAEL. MICHAEL looks back. Then he smiles and continues \n\n\n\n               back to the table. He sits down.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Now I can talk. I feel much better.\n\n               The MAN by the far wall had been stiff with attention; now \n               he too relaxes. SOLLOZZO leans toward MICHAEL who sits down \n               comfortably and his hands move under the table and unbutton \n               his jacket.  SOLLOZZO begins to speak in Sicilian once again \n               but MICHAEL's heart is pounding so hard he can barely hear \n               him.\n\n               The WAITER comes to ask about the order, SOLLOZZO turns to \n               speak, and without warning, MICHAEL shoves the table away \n               from him with his left hand, and with his right hand puts \n               the gun right against SOLLOZZO's head, just touching his \n               temple. He pulls the trigger, and we see part of SOLLOZZO's \n               head blown away, and a spray of fine mist of blood cover the \n               entire area.\n\n               The WAITER looks in amazement; suddenly his white jacket is \n               sprayed and stained with blood.\n\n               SOLLOZZO seems in a perpetual fall to the floor; through he \n               seems to hang in space suspended.\n\n               MICHAEL pivots, and looks:\n\n               There is McCLUSKEY, frozen, the fork with a piece of veal \n               suspended in air before his gaping mouth.\n\n               MICHAEL fires; catching McCLUSKEY in his thick bulging throat.  \n               He makes a horrible, gagging, choking sound. Then coolly, \n               and deliberately, MICHAEL fires again, fires right through \n               McCLUSKEY's white-topped skull.\n\n               The air is filled with pink mist. MICHAEL swings toward the \n               MAN standing by the bathroom wall.\n\n               He does not make a move, seemingly paralyzed.\n\n               Now he carefully shows his hands to be empty.\n\n               The WAITER steps backward through the mist of blood, an \n               expression of horror on his face.\n\n               MICHAEL looks at his two victims:\n\n               SOLLOZZO still in his chair, side of his body propped up by \n               the table.\n\n               McCLUSKEY finally falls from the chair to the table.\n\n               MICHAEL is wildly at a peak. He starts to move out. His hand: \n               is frozen by his side, STILL GRIPPING THE GUN.\n\n               He moves, not letting the gun go.\n\n               MICHAEL's face; frozen in its expression.\n\n               His hand: still holding the gun.\n\n               His face: finally he closes his eyes.\n\n               His hand relaxes, the gun falls to the floor with a dull \n               thud.\n\n               He walks quickly out of the restaurant, looks back.\n\n\n\n               He sees a frozen tableau of the murder; as though it had \n               been recreated in wax.\n\n               Then he leaves.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               INT.

DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)\n\n               A neatly stacked pile of newspapers in the corner of an \n               apartment. We catch a glimpse of one headline: \"Five Family \n               War...\"\n\n               The table. The MEN are sitting around cracking nuts.

(SPRING '46)\n\n               Several cars are parked in front of a pleasant New York \n               apartment building. We recognize a couple of SONNY's \n               bodyguards loafing by the cars, pitching playing cards against \n               the curb.\n\n               Inside the building, two others wait quietly by the rows of \n               brass mailboxes: they have been there quite awhile.\n\n               Up one flight of stairs, a single man sits on the step, \n               smoking a cigarette.\n\n               One of the men by the mailboxes checks his pocketwatch, which \n               is attached to a key chain. We HEAR the sound of a door \n               opening; they look up.\n\n               The man sitting on the stop stands; and looks.\n\n               SONNY backs out of an apartment, the arms of LUCY MANCINI \n               wrapped around him. She doesn't want to let go of him; she \n               draws him back into the apartment for a moment, and then he \n               comes out alone, adjusting his clothes.\n\n               He jauntily skips down the steps, trailed by the bodyguard \n               on the first floor, and moves outside toward his car. The \n               men quickly take up their positions. As he gets in his car:\n\n                                     DRIVER\n                         Pick up your sister?\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Yeah.\n\n               The car drives off; accompanied and escorted by the bodyguards \n               in their cars.\n\n\n\n               INT. DAY: CONNIE'S HALL (SPRING '46)\n\n               He knocks on the door. No answer. Then again.\n\n                                     CONNIE'S VOICE\n                         Who is it?\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         It's me, Sonny.\n\n               We hear the bolt slide back, and see the door open. SONNY \n               enters, but CONNIE has quickly moved into the hallway, her \n               back to him.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                              (tenderly)\n                         Connie, what is it?\n\n               He turns her around in his arms.\n\n               Her face is swollen and bruised; and we can tell from her \n               rough, red eyes that she has been crying for a long time.  \n               As soon as he realizes what's happened, his face goes red \n               with rage. She sees it coming, and clings to him, preventing \n               him from running out of the apartment.\n\n                                     CONNIE\n                              (desperately)\n                         It was my fault! I started a fight \n                         with him and I tried to hit him so \n                         he hit me. He didn't even try to hit \n                         me hard Sonny, I walked into it.\n\n               Sonny listens, and calms himself. He touches her shoulder, \n               the thin silk robe.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         I'm goin' to have the doctor come \n                         over and take a look at you.\n\n               He starts to leave.\n\n                                     CONNIE\n                         Oh Sonny, please don't do anything.\n                         Please don't.\n\n               He stops, and then laughs good naturedly.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Hey. Con. What'm I goin' to do? Make \n                         your kid a orphan before he's born.\n\n               She laughs with him. He kisses her reassuringly, and leaves.\n\n               EXT. DAY: CONNIE'S STREET\n\n               CARLO settles down on the front steps of the 112th St. \"Book\" \n               with SALLY RAGS and COACH, who have been drinking beer out \n               of glasses and a pitcher of beer from around the corner. The \n               ball game is blaring from the radio; and the kids on the \n               street are still playing stickball.\n\n               CARLO has barely settled down, when the kids in the street \n               suddenly scatter, and a car comes screeching up the block \n               and to a halt in front of the candy store. The tires scream, \n               and before it seems as though it has even stopped, a MAN \n               comes hurtling out of the driver's seat, moving so fast the \n               everyone is paralyzed. It is a moment before we recognize \n\n\n\n               that it is SONNY.\n\n               His face is contorted with anger; in a split second he is on \n               the stoop and has CARLO by the throat.\n\n               He pulls CARLO away from the others, trying to get him down \n               into the street. But CARLO reaches out for the iron railing, \n               and hangs on, his hand in a lock, cringing away, trying to \n               hide his head and face in the hollow of the his shoulders. \n               His shirt is ripped away in SONNY's hand.\n\n               SALLY RAGS and COACH, merely sit, watching, stunned.\n\n               SONNY is pounding the cowered CARLO with all his strength, \n               in a continuous monologue of indistinguishable cursing. His \n               blows are powerful; and begin to draw blood.\n\n               The kids who have been playing stickball, move up, watching \n               in fascination.\n\n               CARLO's hands are clenched tight around the railing.\n\n               SONNY beats him mercilessly.\n\n               Now SONNY's bodyguards' car pulls up, and they too become \n               spectators.\n\n               SONNY's tight fists are going down like hammers, into CARLO's \n               face and body.\n\n               CARLO's nose is bleeding profusely; but still he does nothing, \n               other than hang onto the railing.\n\n               SONNY grabs hold of CARLO's massive body, and tries to drag \n               him off of the hold on the railing, his teeth clenched in \n               the effort. Then he tries loosening CARLO's locked hands; \n               even biting them. CARLO screams but he does not let go.\n\n               It's clear that CARLO is much stronger than he is, and will \n               not be moved. SONNY knees him in the mouth, and beats him \n               more; but he is exhausted. Totally out of breath, he stammers \n               haltingly to the bleeding CARLO.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         You... bastard... You... hurt my \n                         sister... again... and I'll kill... \n                         you.\n\n               He wipes the sweat from his face, and then turns suddenly \n               and hurries back to the car, in a moment his car is gone, \n               leaving even his bodyguards in confusion. We notice ONE MAN \n               with a sports jacket in the group of spectators especially \n               interested.\n\n               CARLO finally relaxes the clenched, locked hands. He slumps \n               onto the stoop.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               EXT. DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)\n\n               HIGH ANGLE on the Corleone Mall. It is a gray, rainy day.  \n               Young BUTTON MEN in raincoats stand in quiet groups of various \n               points around the main house and compound. Things have \n               changed; one house has been extensively enlarged; a new and \n               secure gate house has been built. Security measures that had \n               been make-shift and temporarily have now been made a permanent \n\n\n\n               part of the Mall, evolving it into a Medieval Fortress. We \n               notice a huge crater in the courtyard; the result of a recent \n               bomb attempt. The house nearest the crater is damaged by \n               fire.\n\n               A taxi arrives; KAY ADAMS steps out, huddled in a bright \n               yellow raincoat; she lets the cab go, and hurries to the \n               shelter of the gate house.\n\n               They are not expecting her, and ask her to wait while they \n               call the main house.\n\n               KAY looks at the imposing, depressing Mall, while rain still \n               runs down onto her face.\n\n               She notices the bomb crater, and the fire damage; and the \n               sullen faces of the BUTTON MEN.\n\n               TOM HAGEN exits the Main House, and hurries toward her.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         Kay, we weren't expecting you.

Just \n                         wait Kay, he'll contact you.\n\n               We hear footsteps descending the staircase; MAMA CORLEONE \n\n\n\n               enters the room; the OLD WOMAN squints at KAY, evaluating \n               her.\n\n                                     MAMA\n                         You're Mikey's little girl.\n\n               KAY nods yes; there are still tears in her eyes.\n\n                                     MAMA\n                         You eat anything?\n\n               KAY shakes her head.\n\n                                     MAMA\n                              (to HAGEN)\n                         Disgrazia, you don't even give the \n                         poor girl a cup of coffee?\n\n               HAGEN shrugs helplessly; on an impulse, KAY quickly moves \n               toward MAMA, the letter extended.\n\n                                     KAY\n                         Will you give this letter to Michael.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         Mama, no.\n\n                                     MAMA\n                         You tell me what to do?

DAY: DON'S HOSPITAL (SPRING 1946)\n\n               A hospital in New York City. POLICE and teams of PRIVATE \n               DETECTIVES are stationed guarding the area. An ambulance \n               with a team of DETECTIVES and BUTTON-MEN GUARDS exit the \n               hospital with rifles in hand; followed by SEVERAL HOSPITAL \n               ASSISTANTS wheeling a hospital stretcher, presumably carrying \n               the DON.\n\n               TESSIO and CLEMENZA emerge, with OTHER BUTTON MEN bringing \n               up the rear. HAGEN walks with the stretcher, and for a moment \n               they disappear behind the ambulance. Then suddenly, siren \n               blasting, it speeds off, accompanied by dark low-slung cars.\n\n               EXT. DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)\n\n               The Corleone Mall.\n\n               Equally impressive security stands ready at the Corleone \n               Mall.

The WOMEN and CHILDREN, dressed in Sunday \n               clothes, wait.\n\n               EXT. DAY: AMBULANCE (SPRING 1946)\n\n               One ambulance, speeding along the Grand Central Parkway, \n               preceded and followed by a dark car, each one carrying a \n               team of BUTTON MEN.\n\n               Sitting next to the DRIVER of the ambulance is a GUARD with \n               a rifle on his lap.\n\n               INT.

DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\n               The DON is made comfortable in his room, which has all but \n               been converted into a hospital room, with complete and \n               extensive equipment. The various CHILDREN get a turn to kiss \n               the OLD MAN, as he is made comfortable... and then SONNY \n               indicates that all the CHILDREN, WOMEN, and CARLO should \n               leave.\n\n               They do, the door is closed.\n\n               INT. DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\n               The mood is quite happy downstairs, as the WOMEN prepare the \n               Sunday dinner, and set the table.\n\n               CARLO sits alone among them, a frown on his face.\n\n                                     CONNIE\n                         What's the matter, Carlo?\n\n                                     CARLO\n                         Shut up.\n\n               INT. DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\n               All the MEN of the family stand around the hospital bed with \n               grim faces, SONNY and HAGEN closest to the OLD MAN. The DON \n               does not speak, yet he asks questions with his looks and \n               glances, as clearly as if they were verbalized. HAGEN is the \n               spokesman for the family.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         ...since McCluskey's killing, the \n                         police have cracked down on most of \n                         our operations... on the other \n                         families too.

Then he searches around the room \n               for a face he does not see. HAGEN knows who he's looking \n               for.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         Michael...\n                              (he takes a breath)\n                         It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.\n\n               The DON closes his eyes, and then reopens them in anger and \n               rage.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         He's safe now... we're already working \n                         on ways to bring him back.\n\n               The DON is very angry, he motions with a weak hand that they \n               leave him alone.\n\n               INT. DAY: DON'S STAIRS AND HALL (SPRING 1946)\n\n               HAGEN is very upset as he comes down the Stairs; SONNY is \n               expansive and optimistic.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         We'll let the old man take it easy \n                         for a couple of weeks.

You gonna make me something \n                         to eat at least?\n\n               That calms her down; she stands there a moment, breathing \n               heavily; and then she nods, and goes into the kitchen, and \n               starts her wifely duties.\n\n               CARLO is dressed; puts on some cologne; CONNIE appears in \n               the doorway.\n\n                                     CONNIE\n                         The food is on the table.\n\n                                     CARLO\n                         I'm not hungry yet.\n\n                                     CONNIE\n                         Eat it, it's on the table.\n\n                                     CARLO\n                         Ba Fa Goulle.\n\n                                     CONNIE\n                         BA FA GOULE YOU!\n\n               She turns deliberately, goes out into the kitchen. A moment \n               later we begin to hear the sound of dishes breaking. CARLO \n               slowly walks out, where we can see CONNIE systematically \n               smashing all the dishes against the sink, sending the greasy \n               veal and peppers all over the apartment floor.\n\n                                     CARLO\n                         You filthy guinea spoiled brat.

Slowly, \n               he slides his belt out of his trousers, and doubles it in \n               his hand.\n\n                                     CARLO\n                         Clean it up!\n\n               He swings the belt against her heavy hips. She moves back \n               into the kitchen, and gets a kitchen knife, and holds it \n               ready.\n\n                                     CARLO\n                         Even the female Corleones are \n                         murderers.\n\n               He puts the strap down on a table, and moves after her. She \n               makes a sudden thrust at his groin, which he avoids. He pulls \n               the knife away, cutting his hand in the process. She gets \n               away momentarily, but he pursues her around the table, gets \n               her; and starts to slap her in the face.\n\n               She breaks away from him, and rushes into the bedroom.\n\n                                     CONNIE\n                         The baby! The baby!\n\n               INT. DAY: CONNIE'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\n\n\n               She runs into the bedroom; he follows. She moves into a \n               corner, and then like a desperate animal, tries to hide under \n               the bed.\n\n               He reaches under, and pulls her out by the hair.\n\n               He slaps her in the face until she begins to weep; then he \n               throws her on the bed, contemptuously. He grabs part of her \n               thigh, pinching it very hard.\n\n                                     CARLO\n                         You're fat as a pig.\n\n               Then he pushes her away, and walks out of the room, leaving \n               her in tears. She is crying; she pulls herself to the bedroom \n               phone, and in a whisper:\n\n                                     CONNIE\n                         Mama... mama, it's Connie. Mama, I \n                         can't talk any louder. No, I don't \n                         want to talk to Sonny.\n\n               We can tell that the phone has been passed to SONNY.\n\n               INT. DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (SPRING 1946)\n\n               In the kitchen at the Mall, MAMA cannot understand the \n               whispering and she has given the phone to SONNY.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Yeah Connie.\n\n                                     CONNIE (O.S.)\n                         Sonny, just send a car to bring me \n                         home. I'll tell you then, it's nothing \n                         Sonny, don't you come.

You just wait there.\n\n               He hangs up the phone; and just stands there for a moment.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                              (quietly)\n                         That sonofabitch; that sonofabitch...\n\n               HAGEN enters the room; he knows what is happening, knows he \n               cannot interfere.\n\n               EXT. DAY: MALL\n\n               SONNY leaves the house. HAGEN moves to the outside mall just \n               as SONNY's car is driving off. He moves to a group of BUTTON \n               MEN.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         Go after him.\n\n               EXT. DAY: CAUSEWAY (SPRING 1946)\n\n               SONNY's car on the Jones Beach Causeway, speeds quickly by.  \n               After a pause, another car, with the CORLEONE BODYGUARDS, is \n               trailing.\n\n\n\n               SONNY is driving; he is very angry.\n\n               EXT. NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)\n\n               SONNY in his car; driving back. Still breathing hard and \n               still furious. Then he thinks it's funny; he enjoyed it.\n\n               He starts laughing, louder and louder, as he pulls up to a \n               toll booth, stops, and extends his hand with a coin to the \n               COLLECTOR.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               INT. NITE: AMERIGO BONASERA'S APARTMENT\n\n               The serious-faced UNDERTAKER is on the telephone.\n\n                                     HAGEN (O.S.)\n                         This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling for \n                         Don Corleone, at his request.\n\n               BONASERA looks at his WIFE, with deep anxiety in his eyes.  \n               BONASERA's lips are suddenly dry.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         Yes, I understand. I'm listening.\n\n                                     HAGEN (O.S.)\n                         You owe the Don a service. In one \n                         hour, not before, perhaps later, he \n                         will be at your funeral parlor to \n                         ask for your help. Be there to greet \n                         him. If you have any objections speak \n                         now, and I'll inform him.\n\n               Silence. BONASERA stutters, then speaks in fright.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         Anything...

His WIFE knows \n               something serious is happening, and never takes her eyes \n               from him. He lights a cigarette.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         For the last year, they have been \n                         killing one another. So now, what?\n                         Your Godfather comes to me... Why?\n                              (whispering, slyly)\n                         They've killed someone so important \n                         that they wish to make his body \n                         disappear.\n\n\n\n                                     MRS.

They could send me to \n                         jail!\n\n               He slips into his trousers. Then he moves to his WIFE to tie \n               his tie, as she has done for years.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         And if the other families find out... \n                         they will make me their enemy. They \n                         could come here to our house. I curse \n                         the day I ever went to the Godfather.\n\n               EXT. NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)\n\n               With his ring of keys, he opens the funeral parlor, enters.\n\n               INT. NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)\n\n               BONASERA walks through the darkened funeral parlor, without \n               turning on the lights; then into the rear, preparation room, \n               past the tables, and equipment. He operates the chain that \n               lifts a large overhead garage type door. And looks out into \n               the alley.\n\n               He sits on a bench, and waits.\n\n               EXT. NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR ALLEY (SPRING 1946)\n\n               The tires of a car roll very quietly along the small alley; \n               we notice a dark car approach the rear of BONASERA's funeral \n               parlor.\n\n               CLEMENZA gets out, and moves to the open, rear door. BONASERA \n               greets him, too petrified to speak. He notices TWO OTHER MEN \n               get out of the car, and carry a stretcher with a CORPSE \n               swaddled in a gray blanket, with yellowed feet protruding.\n\n               BONASERA closes his eyes in fear, but indicates which way \n               the MEN should carry their sinister burden.\n\n               INT. NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR EMBALMING ROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\n               They carry the CORPSE to one of the tables in the embalming \n               room.\n\n               Then BONASERA turns to see ANOTHER MAN step out of the \n               darkness somewhat uncertainly. It is DON CORLEONE.\n\n               He walks up to BONASERA, very close, without speaking. His \n               cold eyes looking directly at the frightened UNDERTAKER.\n\n               Then, after a long gaze:\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Well my friend, are you ready to do \n                         me this service?\n\n               BONASERA nods. The DON moves to the CORPSE on the embalming \n               table; he makes a gesture, and the OTHER MEN leave them alone.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         What do you wish me to do?\n\n\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                              (staring at the table)\n                         I want you to use all your powers, \n                         all your skill, as you love me. I do \n                         not want his mother to see him as he \n                         is.\n\n               He draws down the gray blanket.\n\n               BONASERA lets out a gasp of horror at what he sees:\n\n               The bullet-smashed face of SONNY CORLEONE.\n\n               EXT. NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)\n\n               SONNY extends his hand with a coin at the toll booth.\n\n               A car suddenly swerves in front of him, trapping him in the \n               booth, and in incredible rally of machine gun fire greets \n               him, coming through and smashing the windows of the toll \n               booths on both side of him, and from the front window of the \n               car blocking him.\n\n               The windows of his car are shot out.\n\n               Bullet holes puncture the doors of his car.\n\n               His hand, with the coin in it, falls inside the car.\n\n               His arms, shoulders are riddled by the fire, and still it \n               continues, as though the ASSASSINS cannot take a chance that \n               he will survive it.\n\n               Suddenly, he lets out an enormous ROAR, like a bull, and \n               actually, opens the door, and steps out of the car, UNDER \n               fire.\n\n               His face is hit; and finally he falls to the ground.\n\n               A FULL SHOT... as the ASSASSINS scramble for their cars and \n               make off in the distance.\n\n               SONNY's BODYGUARDS stop a safe distance away, realizing they \n               are too late.\n\n               INT. NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\n               View on HAGEN's ashen face in the living room. He is silent \n               a moment, and then:\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                              (quietly)\n                         OK. Go to Clemenza's house and tell \n                         him to come here right away. He'll \n                         tell you what to do.\n\n               The MEN leave him alone. He is quiet, standing in the middle \n               of the living room a moment. He looks in the direction of \n               the kitchen, where he can see fragments of MAMA moving around.\n\n               INT. NITE: UPSTAIRS (SPRING 1946)\n\n               TOM proceeds up stairs, and quietly in the direction of the \n               DON's room. He opens the DON's door. Looks in.\n\n               INT. NITE: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\n               The DON in his hospital bed. Asleep under sedation. HAGEN \n\n\n\n               hesitates. He cannot go in; he cannot tell the OLD MAN. He \n               closes the door.\n\n               INT. NITE: DON'S OFFICE (SPRING 1946)\n\n               HAGEN alone in the office. He is drinking. He looks up at \n               the sound of cars; the CAPOREGIMES are arriving. Then he \n               hears footsteps.\n\n               The door opens; and in a robe, with slippers, DON CORLEONE \n               slowly enters the room. He walks directly to his stuffed \n               armchair, sits down. His face is stern, as he looks into \n               HAGEN's eyes.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Give me a drop of anisette.\n\n               HAGEN rises, and pours a glass for the OLD MAN.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         My wife was weeping before she fell \n                         asleep, outside my window I saw my \n                         caporegimes to the house, and it is \n                         midnight. So, Consigliere of mine, I \n                         think you should tell your Don what \n                         everyone knows.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                              (quietly)\n                         I didn't tell Mama anything. I was \n                         about to come up and wake you and \n                         tell you. Just now.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         But you needed a drink first.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         Yes.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Now you've had your drink.\n\n               Pause.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         They shot Sonny on the Causeway.\n                              (pause)\n                         He's dead.\n\n               DON CORLEONE blinks. One feels that just for a second he \n               loses all physical strength; he clasps his hands in front of \n               him on the top of the desk and looks into HAGEN's eyes.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         I want no inquiries made.

An impressive Bank Building in the financial \n               center of New York. Many limousines are parked, uniforms and \n               plain-clothed CHAUFFEURS waiting quietly.\n\n               INT. DAY: BOARD ROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\n               The Board Room of a bank, daylight shines in the windows.\n\n               CARLO TRAMONTI, an impressive, handsome middle-aged man, \n               sits quietly, smoking a Di Napoli cigar, OUR VIEW moves to a \n               MAN sitting to his left, and a little to the rear, and settles \n               on JOSEPH ZALUCHI, a moon-faced amiable-looking man; as the \n               view continues, around the table, we HEAR:\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE (O.S.)\n                         I want to thank you all for coming.\n                         I consider it a service done to me \n                         personally and I am in the debt of \n                         each and every one of you. Especially \n                         those of you who have traveled from \n                         such distances as California, St. \n                         Louis, Kansas City; and New Orleans...\n\n               The VIEW PASSES to FRANK FALCONE and ANTHONY MOLINARI, both \n               younger than any of the others; then on to DOMENICK PANZA, \n               short and squat sitting in a wheelchair; then around the \n               table to DON VINCENENZO FORLENZA, who is whispering to his \n               JEWISH ASSISTANT; the VIEW PASSES on to ANTHONY STRACCI, an \n               older man, sipping from a drink and smoking a cigar; OTTILIO \n               CUNEO, in his middle sixties with a jolly round face; then \n               DON PHILLIP TATTAGLIA, a delicate older man with dyed hair \n               and a pencil mustache; and finally, EMILIO BARZINI, in his \n               early sixties, a man to 'respect'; whom we had seen at \n               CONNIE's Wedding.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Ah well, let's get down to business.\n                         We are all honorable men here, we \n                         don't have to give assurances as if \n                         we were lawyers.\n                              (he sits, gazes out \n                              at them, and sighs)\n                         How did things ever go so far? Well, \n                         no matter. A lot of foolishness has \n                         come to pass. It was so unfortunate, \n                         so unnecessary.\n\n               The VIEW examines the room once again, as the DON speaks. A \n               large, clicking board is changing numbers at various times, \n               and two tapes, showing the fluctuations of the Market during \n               the day's trading, and projected above.\n\n               DON CORLEONE pauses; and TOM HAGEN hands him a cold drink.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Tattaglia has lost a son; I have \n\n\n\n                         lost a son. We are quits. Let there \n                         be a peace...\n                              (he gestures \n                              expressively, \n                              submissively, with \n                              his hands)\n                         That is all I want...\n\n                                     BARZINI\n                         Don Corleone is too modest. He had \n                         the judges and politicians in his \n                         pocket and he refused to share them.\n                         His refusal is not the act of a \n                         friend. He takes the bread out of \n                         the mouths of our families. Times \n                         have changed, it's not like the old \n                         days where everyone can go his own \n                         way. If Don Corleone had all the \n                         judges and politicians in New York, \n                         then he must share them or let others \n                         use them. Certainly he can present a \n                         bill for such services, we're not \n                         Communists, after all. But he has to \n                         let us draw water from the well. \n                         It's that simple.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         My friends, I didn't refuse out of \n                         malice. You all know me. When have I \n                         ever refused an accommodation? But \n                         why, this time? Because I think this \n                         drug business will destroy us in the \n                         years to come. It's not like whiskey \n                         or gambling or even women which most \n                         people want and is forbidden them by \n                         the pezzonovante of the Church and \n                         the Government. But drugs? No. Even \n                         policemen, who help us in gambling \n                         and other things would refuse to \n                         help us in drugs. But... I am willing \n                         to do whatever all of you think is \n                         necessary.\n\n                                     DON ZALUCHI\n                         I don't believe in drugs. For years \n                         I paid my people extra so they \n                         wouldn't do that kind of business... \n                         $200 a week. But it didn't matter.  \n                         Somebody comes to them and says, \"I \n                         have powders, if you put up three, \n                         four thousand dollar investment, we \n                         can make fifty thousand distributing.\"  \n                         Who can resist such a profit? There's \n                         no way to control it, as a business... \n                         to keep it respectable.\n                              (rapping the table)\n                         I don't want it near schools! I don't \n                         want it sold to children. That is an \n                         infamita.\n                              (thinking)\n                         In my city I would try to keep the \n                         traffic in the dark people, the \n                         colored. They are the best customers, \n                         the least troublesome, and they are \n                         animals anyway. They have no respect \n                         for their wives or their families or \n                         themselves. Let them lose their souls \n                         with drugs. But something has to be \n                         done, we can't have everybody running \n\n\n\n                         around doing just what they please, \n                         like a bunch of anarchists.\n\n                                     BARZINI\n                         Then, are we agreed; the traffic in \n                         drugs will be permitted, but \n                         controlled; and Don Corleone agrees \n                         to give it protection in the East.\n\n               DON CORLEONE nods.\n\n                                     BARZINI\n                         That's the whole matter then, we \n                         have the peace, and let me pay my \n                         respects to Don Corleone, whom we \n                         have all known over the years as a \n                         man of his word.\n                              (noticing TATTAGLIA \n                              is uneasy)\n                         Don Philip?\n\n                                     TATTAGLIA\n                         I agree to everything here, I'm \n                         willing to forget my own misfortune.\n                         But I must hear strict assurance \n                         from Corleone. When time goes by and \n                         his position becomes stronger, will \n                         he attempt any individual vengeance?\n\n               They all look at the DON; especially HAGEN, who feels that \n               DON CORLEONE has given a great deal, and must have something \n               else in mind. Slowly the DON rises.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         I forego my vengeance for my dead \n                         son, for the common good. But I have \n                         selfish reasons. My youngest son had \n                         to flee, accused of Sollozzo's murder, \n                         and I must now make arrangements so \n                         that he can come home with safety, \n                         cleared of all those false charges.  \n                         That is my affair, and I will make \n                         those arrangements.\n                              (with strength)\n                         But I am a superstitious man... and \n                         so if some unlucky accident should \n                         befall my youngest son, if some police \n                         officer should accidentally shoot \n                         him, or if he should hang himself in \n                         his cell, or if my son is struck by \n                         a bolt of lightning, then I will \n                         blame some of the people here. That, \n                         I could never forgive, but... aside \n                         from that, let me swear by the souls \n                         of my Grandchildren that I will never \n                         be the one to break the peace we \n                         have made.\n\n               EXT.

No, it was \n                         Barzini all along.\n\n               The black limousine speeds away from us in the night.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               EXT DAY: ESTABLISHING SICILY SHOT\n\n               A CLOSE VIEW OF MICHAEL, moving as he walks, sullen and \n               downcast, the left side of his face healed, but left grotesque \n               and misshapen.\n\n               GRADUALLY, THE VIEW LOOSENS, he wears a warm navy Pea jacket, \n               and walks with his hands in his pockets.\n\n               THE VIEW LOOSENS FURTHER, revealing a Sicilian SHEPHERD on \n               either side of him, each carrying a shotgun slung over his \n               shoulder, CALO, a squat and husky young man with a simple \n               honest quality, and FABRIZZIO, slender and handsome, likable, \n               and with a pleasing build. Each of the SHEPHERDS carry \n               knapsacks.\n\n               The THREE YOUNG MEN continue over the Sicilian landscape, \n               overlooking an impressive view of land and sea.\n\n               EXT. DAY: SICILY ROAD\n\n               The THREE move through a flock of wind-blown sheep, and make \n               their way to a dusty rural road. We HEAR a rinky horn sound, \n               as a pre-war Italian automobile makes its way to them. An \n               OLD MAN peeks from the window, waving to MICHAEL. The car \n               pulls in front of them and stops. MICHAEL nods respectfully.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Don Tommassino.\n\n                                     DON TOMMASSINO\n                         Michael, why must you do this.

I should see this \n                         place.\n\n               DON TOMMASSINO thinks a moment, then concedes.\n\n                                     DON TOMMASSINO\n                         That is your birthright... but \n                         Michael, use this car.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         No... I would like to walk to \n                         Corleone.\n\n               The OLD MAN sighs, and then returns to his car.\n\n                                     DON TOMMASSINO\n                         Be careful Michael, don't let them \n                         know your name.\n\n               The old car sputters off; MICHAEL watches, and then continues \n               on his journey.\n\n               EXT. DAY: COUNTRYSIDE\n\n               The THREE pass through abundant areas of flowers and fruit \n               trees, in bloom and bursting with life.\n\n               EXT. DAY: VILLAGE\n\n               They continue in the empty streets of a little town; the \n               post-war poverty is evident in the skinny dogs; and the empty \n               streets. Occasionally, a military vehicle, the only gasoline-\n               powered vehicles on the road, will pass. And there are many \n               POLICE evident, most of them carrying machine guns.\n\n               The THREE pass under an enormous banner slung over the main \n               road \"VOTA COMMUNISTA\".\n\n\n\n               EXT. DAY: COUNTRY ROAD\n\n               They continue through dusty country roads, where occasionally \n               a donkey pulling a cart, or a lone horseman will pass them.\n\n               EXT. DAY: FIELD\n\n               Out in a field, in the distance, they come upon a procession \n               of peasants and activists, perhaps two hundred strong, \n               marching, and singing, and in the lead, are five or six men \n               carrying billowing red banners.\n\n               EXT. DAY: GROVE\n\n               They are in an orange grove; on the other side of the trees \n               is a deep, tall field of wild flowers.\n\n               The Shepherds unsling their guns and knapsacks, and take out \n               loaves of bread, some wine, sausage and cheese.\n\n               MICHAEL rests against a tree, and uses his handkerchief.\n\n                                     FABRIZZIO\n                         You tell us about America.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         How do you know I come from America?\n\n                                     FABRIZZIO\n                         We hear.

DAY: ANOTHER ROAD\n\n               The TRIO continues down a dirt road, as an American Military \n               convoy speeds by; FABRIZZIO waves, and calls out to each of \n               the U.S. drivers, as they move by.\n\n                                     FABRIZZIO\n                         America. Hey America! Take me with \n                         you! Hey, take me to America G.I.!\n\n               EXT. DAY: CORLEONE HILL\n\n               They continue their long hike, high on a promontory; until \n               they hesitate, and look down.\n\n                                     CALO\n\n\n\n                         Corleone.\n\n               They can see a grim Sicilian village, almost devoid of people.\n\n               EXT. DAY: CORLEONE STREET\n\n               MICHAEL and his bodyguards move through the empty streets of \n               the village. They walk behind him, and spread to either side \n               about fifteen feet away from him.\n\n               They move down ancient steps, past an old stone fountain.  \n               MICHAEL hesitates, cups his hands and drinks some water.\n\n               They go on.\n\n               They move up a very narrow old street. MICHAEL looks at the \n               doorways that they pass.\n\n               MOVING VIEW: Each door has a plaque, with a ribbon or flower.\n\n               CALO sees MICHAEL looking.\n\n                                     CALO\n                         The names of the dead.\n\n               MICHAEL hesitates in the center of the main street. He looks.\n\n               The street is empty, barren. Occasionally, an old woman will \n               pass.\n\n               MICHAEL turns his head.\n\n               The other side of the street: empty and deathly.\n\n               A HIGH VIEW of MICHAEL standing in the center of the old \n               street, the shepherds a respectful distance away.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               EXT. DAY: BARONIAL ESTATE\n\n               A green ribboned field of a baronial Estate. Further ahead \n               is a villa so Roman it looks as though it had just been \n               discovered in the ruins of Pompeii. There is a group of young \n               village GIRLS accompanied by two stocky MATRONS, dressed in \n               black. They have been gathering the pink sulla, purple \n               wisteria, and mixing them with orange and lemon blossoms. \n               They are singing, off in the distance as they work.\n\n               MICHAEL, CALO and FABRIZZIO are silent as they watch this \n               Fantasy-like scene.\n\n                                     FABRIZZIO\n                              (calling out to them)\n                         Hey, beautiful girls!\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                              (sternly)\n                         Shhhhh.\n\n               He settles down to watch.\n\n               The GIRLS are dressed in cheap gaily painted frocks that \n               cling to their bodies. They are still in their teens, but \n               developed and womanly.\n\n               They are moving along the fields, picking blossoms, not aware \n               of the three men watching them from the orange grove.\n\n\n\n               Three or four of the girls begin chasing one of them \n               playfully, in the direction of the grove.\n\n               The GIRL being chased holds a bunch of purple grapes in her \n               left hand and with the right, picks more grapes, and throws \n               them back at her pursuers laughing.\n\n               They come closer and closer. Just short of the grove, she \n               poses, startled, her large, oval shaped eyes catching the \n               view of the THREE MEN. She stands there on her toes about to \n               run.\n\n               MICHAEL sees her; now face to face. He looks.\n\n               Her face. Incredibly beautiful with olive skin, black hair \n               and a rich mouth.\n\n                                     FABRIZZIO\n                              (murmuring)\n                         Jesus Christ, take my soul. I'm dying.\n\n               Quickly, she turns, and runs away.\n\n               MICHAEL stands up never taking his eyes from her. We hold on \n               him for a long while; and eventually hear the SHEPHERDS \n               laughing. Then he turns to them.\n\n                                     FABRIZZIO\n                         You got hit by the thunderbolt, eh?\n\n               CALO pats him on the shoulder.\n\n                                     CALO\n                         Easy man.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         What are you talking about?\n\n                                     FABRIZZIO\n                         You can't hide it when you're hit by \n                         the thunderbolt.\n\n               EXT. DAY: BARONIAL VILLAGE\n\n               The little village built attendant to the Baronial Estate, \n               is decked with the flowers the girls had been picking.\n\n               MICHAEL, followed by the bodyguards, moves into the central \n               square, and onto the balcony of a little cafe.\n\n               The proprietor of the cafe, VITELLI, is a short burly man; \n               he greets them cheerfully, and sets a dish of chickpeas at \n               their table.\n\n                                     FABRIZZIO\n                         You know all the girls in this town, \n                         eh? We saw some beauties coming down \n                         the road.

Is your wife coming \n                         with you?\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         No, she's going home to her family.\n                         She'll join me in a few weeks...\n\n\n\n               INT. DAY: VILLA KITCHEN\n\n               MICHAEL, dressed, crosses from the hallway, and into the \n               kitchen. CALO is just finishing a bite. He rises when he \n               sees MICHAEL.\n\n                                     CALO\n                         Should I get your bag?\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         No, I'll get it. Where's Appolonia?\n\n                                     CALO\n                              (smiling)\n                         She is sitting in the driver's seat \n                         of the car, dying to step on the \n                         gas. She'll be a real American woman \n                         before she gets to America.\n\n               MICHAEL smiles.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Tell Fabrizzio and wait for me in \n                         the car.\n\n               He leaves the kitchen, after a quick sip of coffee.\n\n               He looks out from the opening in the doorway.\n\n               EXT. DAY: VILLA COURTYARD\n\n               There is the car, with APPOLONIA sitting in the driver's \n               seat, playing with the wheel like a child.\n\n               CALO moves to the car, and puts a lunch basket in the rear \n               seat.\n\n               Then MICHAEL seems disturbed.\n\n               Over, on the other side of the courtyard, he sees FABRIZZIO \n               disappear through the gate.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                              (muttering to himself)\n                         Where the hell is he going?\n\n               MICHAEL goes down the hallway, and outside.\n\n               MICHAEL steps out into the bright sunlight of the outer \n               courtyard, causing him to shade his eyes.\n\n               APPOLONIA sees him, and waves, motioning that he should stay \n               where he is.\n\n                                     APPOLONIA\n                              (calling out)\n                         I'll drive to you.\n\n               He smiles affectionately.\n\n               CALO stands beside the car, smiling, with his lupara dangling \n               by his side. There is no sight of FABRIZZIO. Suddenly the \n               smile fades from MICHAEL's face. He steps forward and holds \n               out his hand.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         No. No!\n\n\n\n               His shout is drowned in the roar of a tremendous EXPLOSION, \n               as she switched on the ignition.\n\n               Part of the wall is caved in, the kitchen door is blown off; \n               and there is nothing left of the Alpha, or of Appolonia.\n\n               MICHAEL is thrown against the wall, and knocked unconscious.\n\n               INT. DAY: VILLA BEDROOM\n\n               MICHAEL is unconscious in a darkened room. We hear whispering \n               around him, but can't make any of it out. A soft cloth is \n               applied to his face; gradually his eyes open. DON TOMMASSINO \n               is there, close to him. He looks at them and from their grave \n               expressions, he knows his wife is dead.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Fabrizzio. Let your shepherds know \n                         that the one who gives me Fabrizzio \n                         will own the finest pastures in \n                         Sicily.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               EXT. DAY: MALL (SPRING 1951)\n\n               Easter.\n\n               A HIGH VIEW ON THE CORLEONE MALL in the springtime. Hordes \n               of little CHILDREN including many of the Corleone Children \n               and Grandchilren, rush about carrying little Easter baskets, \n               searching here and there for candy treasures and hidden Easter \n               eggs.\n\n               The DON himself, much older, much smaller in size, wearing \n               baggy pants and a plaid shirt and an old hat, moves around \n               his garden, tending rows and rows of rich tomato plants.\n\n               Suddenly, he stops and looks.\n\n               MICHAEL stands there, still holding his suitcase.\n\n               Great emotion comes over the DON, who takes a few steps in \n               MICHAEL's direction.\n\n               MICHAEL leaves his suitcase and walks to his favorite son \n               and embraces him.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Be my son...\n\n               INT.

That was your misfortune.  \n                         I was hunted on the streets of \n                         Corleone when I was twelve years old \n                         because of who my father was.

Who declare wars \n                         they wish us to fight in to protect \n                         what they own. Do you put your fate \n                         in the hands of men whose only talent \n                         is that they tricked a bloc of people \n\n\n\n                         to vote for them?

Pretty \n                         soon there won't be one place in \n                         Brooklyn I can hang my hat.\n\n                                     MICHAEL (O.S.)\n                         Just be patient.\n\n                                     TESSIO\n                         I'm not asking you for help, Mike.\n                         Just take off the handcuffs.\n\n                                     MICHAEL (O.S.)\n                         Be patient.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA (O.S.)\n                         We gotta fight sometime. Let us at \n                         least recruit our regimes to full \n                         strength.\n\n                                     MICHAEL (O.S.)\n                         No, I don't want to give Barzini an \n                         excuse to start fighting.\n\n                                     TESSIO (O.S.)\n                         Mike, you're wrong.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA (O.S.)\n                         Don Corleone... Don Corleone.\n\n               The OLD MAN looks up. CLEMENZA stand before him in the Den.  \n               Beside him is an anxious TESSIO. NERI stands by the door; \n               HAGEN is seated; MICHAEL sits behind the big desk.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         You said there would come a day when \n                         Tessio and me could form our own \n                         Families. Only with your benediction, \n                         of course. I ask permission...\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         My son is head of the Family now. If \n                         you have his permission, you have my \n                         good will.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         In six months you can break off from \n                         the Corleone Family and go on your \n                         own. Carlo, I'm counting on you to \n                         make the move to Nevada; you'll be \n                         my right-hand man out there. Tom \n                         Hagen is no longer the Consigliere.\n\n               Everyone is a bit surprised; look to see HAGEN's reaction.\n\n               He remains inexpressive.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas. \n                         Nobody goes to him with any other \n                         business as of now, this minute. No \n                         reflection on Tom; that's the way I \n                         want it. Besides, if I ever need any \n                         advice, who's a better Consigliere \n                         than my father.\n\n\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         Then in a six month time we're on \n                         our own; is that it?\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Maybe less...\n\n                                     TESSIO\n                         Let us fill up our Regimes.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         No. I want things very calm for \n                         another six months.\n\n                                     TESSIO\n                         Forgive me, Godfather, let our years \n                         of friendship be my excuse. How can \n                         you hope for success there without \n                         your strength here to back you up? \n                         The two go hand in hand. And with \n                         you gone from here the Barzini and \n                         the Tattaglias will be too strong \n                         for us.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         And I don't like Barzini. I say the \n                         Corleone Family has to move from \n                         strength, not weakness. We should \n                         build our Regimes and take back our \n                         lost territories in Staten Island, \n                         at least.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Do you have faith in my judgement?\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         Yes, Godfather...\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Then do what Michael says...\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         All I can say is that things are \n                         being resolved that are more effective \n                         than a thousand buttonmen on the \n                         streets. Understood?\n\n               There are uneasy looks all around.\n\n                                     CARLO\n                         Understood. I just wish I was doing \n                         more to help out.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         I'll come to you when I need you.\n\n               He looks at CLEMENZA, TESSIO and HAGEN. They all nod, \n               reluctantly.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         All right, then it's resolved.\n\n               NERI knows the meeting is over, he opens the Den's door.\n\n               CLEMENZA and TESSIO pay their respects to the DON and leave, \n               then CARLO. NERI watches CARLO as he walks down the corridor, \n               casting a nervous look back at the sinister man.\n\n\n\n               Then NERI closes the door.\n\n               MICHAEL relaxes.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         Mike, why are you cutting me out of \n                         the action?\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Tom, we're going to be legitimate \n                         all the way, and you're the legal \n                         man. What could be more important \n                         than that.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         I'm not talking about that. I'm \n                         talking about Rocco Lampone building \n                         a secret regime. Why does Neri report \n                         directly to you, rather than through \n                         me or a caporegime?\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         I told you that it wouldn't escape \n                         his eye.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         How did you find out?\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's \n                         men are all a little too good for \n                         the jobs they're supposed to be doing. \n                         They get a little more money than \n                         the job's worth.\n                              (pause)\n                         Lampone's a good man; he's operating \n                         perfectly.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Not so perfectly if you noticed.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         Mike, why am I out?\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         You're not a wartime Consigliere.\n                         Things may get tough with the move \n                         we're trying.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         OK, but then I agree with Tessio. \n                         You're going about it all wrong; \n                         you're making the move out of \n                         weakness... Barzini's a wolf, and if \n                         he tears you apart, the other families \n                         won't come running to help the \n                         Corleones...\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Tom, I never thought you were a bad \n                         Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad \n                         Don, rest in peace. He had a good \n                         heart but he wasn't the right man to \n                         head the family when I had my \n                         misfortune. Michael has all my \n                         confidence, as you do. For reasons \n                         which you can't know, you must have \n                         no part in what will happen.\n\n\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         Maybe I can help.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                              (coldly)\n                         You're out, Tom.\n\n               TOM pauses, thinks... and then he nods in acquiescence. TOM \n               leaves.\n\n               MICHAEL looks at NERI.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         I'm going to talk to my father.\n\n               NERI nods, and then leaves. The DON opens the doors, breathes \n               in the air, and steps outside.\n\n               EXT.

They argue in gambling \n                         games; they jump out of their cars \n                         in a rage if someone so much as \n                         scratches their fender. These people \n                         wander through the streets calling \n                         out \"Kill me, kill me.\" Luca Brasi \n                         was like that. And since he wasn't \n                         scared of death, and in fact, looked \n                         for it... I made him my weapon. \n                         Because I was the only person in the \n                         world that he truly hoped would not \n                         kill him. I think you have done the \n                         same with this man.\n\n               They walk through the DON's vegetable garden. Tomatoes, \n               peppers, carefully tended, and covered with a silky netting.  \n               MICHAEL follows; the DON turns and looks at him.

He lets Michael do all the work. \n                         He just plays the fool with his \n                         garden, his peppers, his tomatoes, \n                         as if he was some peasant still.  \n                         But men are like that...\n\n               She stops toward the Church.\n\n                                     MAMA\n                         You come in, too.\n\n               KAY shakes her head.\n\n                                     MAMA\n                         The Priest ain't gonna bite you cause \n                         you're not Catholic.\n                              (whispered)\n                         He's in the back drinkin' his wine.\n\n               KAY laughs and follows MAMA up the steps of the Church.  \n               They enter.\n\n               INT. DAY: CHURCH (1955)\n\n               Inside the Church, KAY watches as MAMA blesses herself from \n               the holy water.\n\n                                     MAMA\n                         You can.\n\n               Tentatively, KAY dips her fingers into the water, and blesses \n               herself. Then SHE follows MAMA down the aisle, in awe at the \n               high ceiling, the art, the windows, and finally the Altar.\n\n               MAMA stops by the impressive tiers of candles. There is a \n               large coin box for those who wish to pay for lighting candles.  \n               MAMA fumbles in her purse for change; KAY gives her some.\n\n               MAMA drops the coins in the box, one by one; then takes the \n               taper, and in a pattern known only to her, and with great \n               dignity, she closes her eyes, says a prayer, and then lights \n\n\n\n               twenty candles.\n\n               She finishes, and bows her head.\n\n               EXT. DAY: BONASERA'S FUNERAL HOME\n\n               Very few people in the streets. TOTAL SILENCE. But black \n               flower cars as far as the eye can see, for blocks and blocks.\n\n               An expression of respect, of honor and fear that is enormous.\n\n               Certainly no more could be done for a President or a King.\n\n               Each car carries an elaborate floral decoration. We show \n               these in detail; and the flowered messages: \"A Benefactor to \n               Mankind\", \"He Knew and Pitied\"... \"Our Don Our Leader\"... \n               \"The Sacred Heart\"...\n\n               EXT. DAY: MALL (1955)\n\n               HIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL\n\n               Silence.\n\n               The flower cars, funeral limousines, and private cars fill \n               all the areas attendant to the Corleone residence.\n\n               Hundreds of people fill the Mall, reminiscent in size of the \n               wedding of Connie and Carlo; of course, now the mood is somber \n               and respectful.\n\n               MICHAEL, MAMA, FREDO and HAGEN stand by the flowered platform \n               which holds the ornate coffin. We cannot see the remains of \n               Don Corleone.\n\n               BONASERA is nearby, ready to do service to the bereaved \n               family. One by one the mourners come by, weeping, or merely \n               with grave expressions; pay their respects and continue on.\n\n               The VIEW ALTERS, and we see that the line is endless. JOHNNY \n               FONTANE, tears openly falling, takes his turn.\n\n               Children are taken by the hand, and lifted for their last \n               look at the great man.\n\n               CLEMENZA whispers into the ear of LAMPONE. LAMPONE immediately \n               arranges for the members of the Five New York Families to \n               pay their respects.\n\n               First CUNEO, then STRACHI and then ZALUCHI. Then PHILIP \n               TATTAGLIA, who merely passes by the Coffin.\n\n               Then BARZINI in a black homburg, standing a long time.\n\n               MICHAEL watches the scene.\n\n               BARZINI crosses himself and passes on, immediately rejoined \n               by his men.\n\n               As BARZINI leaves, it seems as though everyone is fawning on \n               him; perhaps asking for favors: But at any rate, it is clear \n               from the doors opened for him, the cigars lit for him, that \n               he is the new Capo di Capi--the place formerly held by Don \n               Corleone.\n\n               MICHAEL watches silently.\n\n               BARZINI is searching for somebody with his eyes. First \n               CLEMENZA. Then TESSIO.\n\n\n\n               CONNIE rushes into MICHAEL's arms, tears in her eyes. He \n               embraces and comforts her.\n\n               Everywhere MICHAEL goes, NERI is a few feet away--watching \n               all who come close to him.\n\n               EXT. DAY: MALL (LATER)\n\n               Later on the Mall; some people have left, although there are \n               still hundreds of mourners.\n\n               A young GIRL approaches TESSIO. She's about 18.\n\n                                     GIRL\n                         Do you remember me?\n\n                                     TESSIO\n                         No...\n\n                                     GIRL\n                         We danced together at Connie's \n                         wedding.\n\n               TESSIO makes a gesture, which is to say 'How you've grown', \n               and they move though the crowd, looking for Michael. He finds \n               him.\n\n                                     TESSIO\n                         Mike, could I have a minute?\n\n               MIKE; nods; and they move to a private place. NERI is close \n               by.\n\n                                     TESSIO\n                         Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.\n                         Says we can straighten any of our \n                         problems out.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         He talked to you?\n\n                                     TESSIO\n                              (nods)\n                         I can arrange security.\n\n               MICHAEL looks at him.\n\n               EXT. DAY: CEMETERY (1955)\n\n               The Cemetery. Late day.\n\n               The hundreds of cars, limousines and flower cars line the \n               stone wall that surrounds this Italian-Catholic cemetery in \n               Queens Village.\n\n               Hundreds of people stand in a cluster; others watch; take \n               pictures, etc.\n\n               MICHAEL stands with his family, his MOTHER... and TOM HAGEN.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                              (softly)\n                         Christ, Tom; I needed more time with \n                         him.

In Brooklyn on \n                         Tessio's ground, where I'll be safe.\n\n               HAGEN looks at him; understands.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         But after the Baptism.

DAY: NERI'S APT. (1955)\n\n               ALBERT NERI moves around in his small Corona Apartment; he \n               pulls a small trunk from under his bed. He opens it, and we \n               see in it, nearly folded, a New York City Policeman's uniform.  \n               He takes it out piece by piece, almost reverently. Then the \n               badge, and the identification card; with his picture on it.  \n               Slowly, in the solitude of his room, he begins to dress.\n\n               INT. DAY: MICHAEL'S BEDROOM (1955)\n\n               MICHAEL and KAY are getting dressed for the christening in \n               their room. MICHAEL looks very well; very calm; KAY is \n               beginning to take on a matronly look.\n\n               INT. DAY: MOTEL ROOM (1955)\n\n               In a Long Island motel.\n\n               ROCCO LAMPONE carefully disassembles a revolver; oils it, \n               checks it, and puts it back together.\n\n               EXT. DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (1955)\n\n               PETER CLEMENZA about to get in his Lincoln. He hesitates, \n               takes a rag and cleans some dirt off of the fender, and then \n               gets in, drives off.\n\n\n\n               EXT. DAY: CHURCH (1955)\n\n               The Church.\n\n               Various relatives and friends are beginning to gather at the \n               Church. They laugh and talk. A MONSIGNOR is officiating.\n\n               Not all of the participants have arrived yet.\n\n               CONNIE is there, with a beaming CARLO. She holds the infant; \n               showing him off to interested people.\n\n               EXT. DAY: U.N.

On his \n               side of the street, he spots a limousine waiting directly \n               across from the main entrance of the building. Slowly he \n               approaches the limo, and taps on its fender with his \n               nightstick.\n\n               The DRIVER looks up in surprise.\n\n               NERI points to the \"No Parking\" sign.\n\n               The DRIVER turns his head away.\n\n                                     NERI\n                         OK, wise guy, you wanna summons, or \n                         you wanna move?\n\n                                     DRIVER\n                              (obviously a hood)\n                         You better check with your precinct.\n\n                                     NERI\n                         Move it!\n\n               The DRIVER takes a ten dollar bill, folds it deliberately, \n\n\n\n               and hands it out the window, trying to put it under NERI's \n               jacket.\n\n               NERI backs up, letting the bill fall onto the street. Then \n               he crooks a finger at the DRIVER.\n\n                                     NERI\n                         Let me see you license and \n                         registration.\n\n               EXT. DAY: MOTEL BALCONY\n\n               LAMPONE on the motel balcony spots a Cadillac pulling up.\n\n               It parks. A young, pretty GIRL gets out. Quickly, he returns \n               into the room.\n\n               INT. DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955)\n\n               CLEMENZA is climbing the back stairs of a large hotel.

After all, I'm Godfather \n                         to your son. No, your punishment is \n                         that you're out of the family \n                         business. I'm putting you on a plane \n                         to Vegas--and I want you to stay \n                         there. I'll send Connie an allowance, \n                         that's all. But don't keep saying \n                         you're innocent; it insults my \n                         intelligence and makes me angry.

He chokes and leaps \n               up like a fish on a line, kicking his feet.\n\n\n\n               The garrote is pulled tighter; CARLO's face turns color.\n\n               His thrashing feet kick right through the front windshield.\n\n               Then the body goes slack.\n\n               CLEMENZA makes a foul face, and opens the window as the car \n               drives off.\n\n               EXT.

It is FABRIZZIO.\n\n\n\n               VIEW ON MICHAEL. Gunfire from under his coat. FABRIZZIO is \n               cut down. MICHAEL throws the gun down; turns and exits.\n\n               EXT. DAY: MALL (1955)\n\n               HIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL\n\n               Several moving vans are parked in the Mall; one feels that \n               these are the final days; the families are moving out; signs \n               indicating that the property is for sale are evident.\n\n               A black limousine pulls up, and before it has even stopped, \n               the rear door flies open, and CONNIE attempts to run out, \n               restrained by MAMA. She manages to break free and runs across \n               the Mall into Michael's house.\n\n               INT. DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (1955)\n\n               Inside the Corleone house.

All the time he knew he \n                         was going to kill my husband. But he \n                         didn't dare while my father was alive.  \n                         And then he stood Godfather to our \n                         child.

DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (1955)\n\n               She moves back into the kitchen and begins to prepare the \n               drinks. From her vantage point, as she smilingly makes the \n               drinks, she sees CLEMENZA, NERI and ROCCO LAMPONE enter the \n               house with their BODYGUARDS.\n\n               She watches with curiosity, as MICHAEL stands to receive \n               them. He stands arrogantly at ease, weight resting on one \n               foot slightly behind the other. One hand on his hip, like a \n               Roman Emperor. The CAPOREGIMES stand before him.\n\n               CLEMENZA takes MICHAEL's hand, kissing it.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         Don Corleone...\n\n\n\n               The smile fades from KAY's face, as she looks at what her \n               husband has become.\n\n               INT. DAY: CHURCH (1955)\n\n               KAY wears a shawl over her hand.

ROCCO LAMPONE kisses his hand.\nThen it is taken away.  We can SEE only the empty desk and\nchair of Michael's father, Vito Corleone.  We HEAR, over\nthis, very faintly a funeral dirge played in the distance,\nas THE VIEW MOVES SLOWLY CLOSER to the empty desk and chair.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT. A SICILIAN LANDSCAPE - FULL VIEW - DAY\n\nWe can barely make out the funeral procession passing over\nthe burnt-brown of a dry river bed.  The figures move\nslowly, seemingly from out of hundreds of years of the past.\n\nThe MUSICIANS walking unsteadily on the rocky bed, their\ninstruments harsh and blaring.\n\nThey are followed by six young peasant men, carrying the\ncrude wooden coffin on their shoulders.  Then the widow, a\nstrong large woman, dressed in black, and not accepting the\narms of those walking with her.\n\nBehind her, not more than twenty relatives, few children and\npaisani continue alone behind the coffin.\n\nSuddenly, we HEAR the shots of the lupara, and the musicians\nstop their playing.  The entire procession scatters in odd\ndirections along the rocky river bed.\n\nThe young men struggle with the burden of the heavy coffin,\nthrowing it out of balance and nearly crashing to the ground.\nWe hear a woman SCREAMING:\n\nWOMAN\n(Sicilian)\n\nThey've killed young Paolo!  They've\nkilled the boy Paolo!\n\nEXT. SICILIAN LANDSCAPE - MED. VIEW - DAY\n\nacross the slain body of a fourteen year old boy, lying on\nthe parched ground.  In the distance we see four or five of\nthe mourning women, the wind blowing their black dresses and\nveils, running up to the body of the boy.  They begin to\nwail, and cry out in anguished Sicilian, as the widow, the\nmother of the murdered boy, holds her child in her arms, his\nfresh blood wetting her strong hands.\n\nEXT. BARONIAL ESTATE - TIGHT MOVING VIEW - DAY\n\nA boy, eight or nine, with wide, frightened eyes, being\npulled quickly by the hand.  This is VITO ANDOLINI, who is\nto become The Godfather.\n\nThe VIEW ALTERS revealing that he is being pulled along by\nhis Mother, the Widow, across a field leading to the\nornamental gates of a Baronial Estate of some forgotten Noble.\n\nAt various positions near the gates are men with shotguns,\nor lupara.  The gates are opened; and the Widow and her boy\nare shown before DON FRANCESCO, a man in his sixties.  He\nwears his trousers with suspenders, and an open white shirt\nsloppily tucked in over his enormous belly.  He wears a hat\nto protect him from the white-hot sun, and proudly displays\na gold watch and chain over his vest.\n\nHe sits in a chair, near a group of his men in the garden,\nlistening to the Widow, who stands before him with her only\nson.\n\n\n\nWIDOW\n(Sicilian)\n\nDon Francesco.  You murdered my\nhusband, because he would not bend.\nAnd his oldest son Paolo, because\nhe swore revenge.  But Vitone is\nonly nine, and dumb-witted.

He is all I have.  In\nthe name of the Holy Spirit, I\nswear he will never be a danger to\nyou...\n\nSuddenly, she reaches under her skirt, where she has hidden\na kitchen knife.\n\nWIDOW\n(continuing)\n\nBut I will kill you myself!\n(she lunges at the\nMafia chieftain)\n\nVitone, go!\n\nThe boy runs as fast as he can out through the gates.  Then\nthere is a lupara blast.  He turns, and sees his Mother\nflung a distance of five feet from the short range of the\nterrible blast of the shotgun.  Then he sees the men turn\ntheir attention to him.  One fires at him; but the boy is\nquick, and disappears into a grove of olive trees.\n\nEXT. STREETS OF CORLEONE - NIGHT\n\nTwo men roam the deserted streets of Corleone, carrying\nlupare.  Every so often, they stop, and one shouts in a\nloud, almost singsong voice, like a fish peddler.

A BARN - NIGHT\n\nFour little girls watch with wide eyes as their mother and\nfather bind Vito tightly in swaddled cloth, and then lift\nhim up to the side of a mule; counter-balancing a heavy load\nof firewood.  The father looks at the boy's almost stoically\ncalm little face.\n\nFATHER\n(Sicilian)\n\nVito...We pray for you.\n\nHe pulls the fabric over the boy's face.\n\nMOSCA\n(Sicilian O.S.)\n\n...Andolini...\n\nSTROLLO\n(Sicilian O.S.)\n\nOur Friend promises misery to any\nfamily...\n\nEXT.

STEAMSHIP - CLOSE VIEW ON VITO - DAY\n\nhuddled in blankets, on the deck of the ship in Steerage.\nHe does not say a word.  The Waltz grows louder as the VIEW\nALTERS, revealing the hundreds of immigrant families huddled\ntogether with all their earthly possessions on their way to\nAmerica.\n\nThen, suddenly, the Waltz stops.\n\nTHE NEW YORK HARBOR - DAY\n\nSILENCE.

ELLIS PROCESSING HALL - DAY\n\nThe hundreds of immigrant families sit on rows of benches in\nthe great hall.  Various painted lines lead to the steps and\nprocessing rooms above.\n\nThere is the babble of many interviews going on\nsimultaneously, uncertainly, in different languages.\n\nVito is bundled in an old coat, with a large tag pinned on\nit: \"Vitone Andolini -- Corleone, Sicilia.\"\n\nHe stands, moves up in the line, when several other immigrant\nboys, older than he, rush up an push him back in the line.\nWeak from the trip, he falls to the floor.  The boys laugh,\nderisive in a language he cannot understand.  He struggles\nto his feet, lifting his makeshift bags; staring at them in\nan icy hatred.\n\nINT. PROCESSING ROOM - DAY\n\nThree or four interviews are crowded into the small room;\nthey are conducted in English.  From the expression on\nVito's face, and from the fragmented of the English, we\nrealize that he doesn't understand a word of it.\n\nOFFICIAL\n(English)\n\nWhat is your name?\n\nThe man waits, impatiently.\n\nOFFICIAL\n\n\n\nYour name?\n\nVito doesn't answer.

The guard moves to the boy, reads his new\nname tag.  And then, not unkindly:\n\nGUARD\nThat's you.\n\nHe opens the door, and Vito enters the room.\n\nEXT. THE STATUE OF LIBERTY - DAY\n\nThe VIEW slowly begins to pull back, revealing this to be\nthe view from inside the quarantine cell, where Vito stands\non his bench, looking out to the statue through the barred\nwindow.\n\nThen he turns, and sits in the corner.  He is silent for a\n\n\n\nlong time.\n\nThen, in a sweet, pure voice, he sings to himself in Sicilian.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - MOVING CLOSE SHOT - DAY\n\nA nine year old boy, dressed immaculately in white, with a\nlarge white silk bow tied to his shoulder, moving slowly\ndown the aisle of the church with a group of other children\ndressed in white.  He has dark black hair, and his face is\nunmistakably similar to young Vito's.  He moves slowly, his\nhands clasped around a golden missal.

LAKE TAHOE ESTATE - DAY\n\nThe lawns of this great estate on the shore of Lake Tahoe\nare covered with guests of a wonderful party to honor the\nFirst Holy Communion of Anthony Corleone, the son of Mr. and\nMrs. Michael Corleone.  A full dance orchestra plays music\nof the times on a pavilion bandstand built especially for\nthe occasion.

He is accompanied by an\nassociate-bodyguard, WILLY CICCI; thin and dark, and also\ndressed up for the occasion.  Frankie tries to get the\nattention of one of the waiters; a college-groomed young man\nin white sports jacket and black bow-tie.\n\nPENTANGELI\nHey, kid!

He died many years ago,\nand ever since I've felt much more\nof a father than an uncle.  I love\nher very much.  I'm pleased and\nimpressed that you had the thought\nto come to me before going on with\nyour plans.  It shows me that\nyou're a considerate man, and will\nbe good to her.  What are you\nstudying in college?\n\nGARDNER\nMy major is Fine Arts, sir.\n\nMICHAEL\nHow will Fine Arts support your new\nwife?\n\nGARDNER\nIt's embarrassing to say, sir, but\nI'm a major stockholder in the\nfamily corporation.\n\nMICHAEL\n(smiling)\n\nNever be embarrassed by your wealth.\nThis recent contempt for money is\nstill another trick of the rich to\nkeep the poor without it.\n\n(warmly)\nOf course I give you my blessing.\nLet's set the wedding soon...it\nwill be my pleasure to give the\nbride away.\n\nThey all smile, and rise.\n\nMICHAEL\n(continuing)\n\n...and take a few courses in\nBusiness Administration just to be\non the safe side!\n\nThey laugh; Michael moves toward them.

He owns\na small pizza parlor in Buffalo...\n\nCLOSE ON THE PICTURES\n\nSnapshots of a middle-aged man, handsome, Italian.  There is\nsomething familiar about him.\n\nNERI (O.S.)\n(continuing)\n\n...American wife and two small kids.\nWe traced him and found that he's\nin the country illegally, from\nSicily...\n\nMichael looks at another picture.  The same man.  Only\nyounger, and dressed in Sicilian shepherd's clothing.  We\nremember him as FABRIZZIO...Michael's traitorous bodyguard\nin Sicily.\n\nNERI (O.S.)\n...came over around 1956.  Sponsored\nby the Barzini Family.\n\nMichael puts the pictures down.\n\nMICHAEL\nIt's him.  Fabrizzio.\n\n(almost to himself)\nRevenge is a dish that tastes best\nwhen it's cold.\n\nNERI\nHow do you want me to handle it?\n\nMichael glances at Hagen, who has been waiting in the room.\n\nMICHAEL\nLater.  Tom?\n\nHagen brings him a folder; then, as Michael glances through\nit:\n\nHAGEN\nI've cleared it through the\n\n\n\nSenator's chief aide, a man named\nTurnbull.  Turnbull's a heavy\ngambler, and into us for over a\nhundred grand, so I figure his\ninformation is reliable.\n\nNeri moves to the bar, to prepare Michael a drink.\n\nHAGEN\nThe Senator can be set up; but he\nthinks of himself as a clean\npolitician.  So it's got to be on\nterms he can live with: campaign\ncontribution, donation to a\ncharitable cause that he controls,\nthings like that.  If he gets even\nthe inkling that you think you're\nbuying him, he'll freeze up.\nNevada's a funny state, they like\nthings both ways here... All right.\nTurnbull says the Senator will be\nhere at two-thirty, and he's been\nprimed.  He knows you'll want to\nmeet with him alone, and he knows\nit's about the Tropicana's license.\nAt any rate, he expects to be\nintroduced around to some of the\ninfluential people here today, and\ngenerally treated as an ordinary\nguest.  Just go light on him,\nMikey, sometimes the biggest crooks\ndon't like to think of themselves\nas crooks...\n\nMichael glances at Hagen, as though that last remark was\nunnecessary.\n\nHAGEN\nI'm sorry; of course, you know that.\n\nMICHAEL\nTwo-thirty.  That gives me time to\nsee my boy.\n\nHAGEN\nConnie's outside.\n\nMichael doesn't want to see her.\n\nHAGEN\nI promised; she said it was urgent.\n\nMichael nods.\n\nMICHAEL\nAll right.  Apologize to Pentangeli.\n\nNeri opens the door; Hagen exits, and Connie steps in\nimpatiently, followed by Merle.\n\nMICHAEL\nI said I would see my sister, alone.\n\nMERLE\nI think this concerns me too.\n\n(taking a cigarette\nfrom the dispenser)\n\nYou don't, do you?\n\n\n\nConnie steps forward, kisses Michael on the cheek.\n\nCONNIE\nHow are you, honey?  You've met\nMerle, haven't you.  He was with me\nin Vegas.\n\nMICHAEL\nI saw him with you.\n\nCONNIE\nWe're going to Europe next week.  I\nwant to get passage booked on the\nQueen.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhy do you come to me?  Why don't\nyou go to a travel agent?\n\nMERLE\nWe're going to get married first.\n\nMichael is silent.  Then he rises, and moves to the window\noverlooking the lake.\n\nMICHAEL\nThe ink on your divorce isn't dry.\nYour children see you on weekends;\nyour oldest boy, Michael Francis...\nwas in some trouble with the Reno\npolice over some petty theft that\nyou don't even know about.\n\nCONNIE\nMichael...\n\nMICHAEL\nYou fly around the world with lazy\nyoung men who don't have any love\nfor you, and use you like a whore.\n\nCONNIE\nYou're not my father!\n\nMICHAEL\nThen why do you come to me?\n\nCONNIE\nBecause I need MONEY!\n\nMICHAEL\n(softly)\n\nConnie, I want to be reasonable\nwith you.  You have a house here,\nwith us.  You can live here with\nyour kids...and you won't be\ndeprived of anything.  I don't know\nmuch about Merle; I don't know what\nhe does for a living; what he lives\non.  Why don't you tell him marriage\nis really out of the question; and\nthat you can't see him any more.\nHe'll understand.  But if you\ndisobey me, and marry this pimp...it\nwould disappoint me.\n\nCONNIE\nIt was my father's money; and I'm\nentitled to what I need.  Where is\n\n\n\nTom Hagen?\n\nShe turns angrily, leaving Michael standing face to face\nwith Merle.\n\nMICHAEL\nAre you finished?\n\nMERLE\nI think so.\n\nMICHAEL\nThen out.\n\nMerle puts out his cigarette and leaves, quickly.\n\nEXT. TAHOE PAVILION - FULL VIEW - DAY\n\nThe orchestra has struck up a \"Paul Jones,\" where two\nconcentric circles of young people march in opposite\ndirections, until the music stops.  Then they take whomever\nis opposite them as their new dance partner.\n\nVIEW ON THE HARBOR AREA\n\nFrancesca and her twin, Gardner and their elite young\nfriends roar out of the private harbor, to get up on the\nwater skis.  We notice ROCCO LAMPONE, move along a path\nleading to a separate and more private boathouse.  A small\ncovered craft approaches, ties off, and a group of three men\nstep on to the pathway, shake hands with Lampone - and\nfollow him to the large boathouse where Michael conducts his\nbusiness.\n\nCLOSE VIEW\n\nPentangeli has led Mama up to the dance floor, and is having\nsome difficulty with the orchestra.\n\nPENTANGELI\nI can't believe that out of thirty\nprofessional musicians, not one of\nyou is Italian!\n\n(as the musicians laugh)\nC'mon, give us a tarantella.\n\nHe waves his hands, conducting, and singing.  The piano\nstarts a vamp, the drums uncertainly join in.  A clarinet\nstarts to play \"Pop Goes the Weasel,\" and soon the rest of\nthe orchestra is playing that.  They look to Pentangeli for\napproval.  Disgusted, he goes back to his table, eating a\nhandful of canapes.\n\nINT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY\n\nRocco ushers an older Italian, bundled up against the cold\nand wet of his boatride, to Michael.\n\nThe man shows respect to Michael, who quickly indicates that\nNeri should get him a drink.\n\nMICHAEL\nRocco, his friends must be hungry.\nSee what you can do, but I'd like\nto keep them away from the guests.\n\nThe older man, JOHNNY 'BLUE BOY' OLA, gestures to his\nbodyguards, and they follow Lampone.\n\n\n\nMICHAEL\nYou know my lawyer, Tom Hagen.\nJohnny Ola.\n\nOLA\nSure, I remember Tom from the old\ndays.\n\nTom shakes hands with Ola, remembering him, and his\nimportance.\n\nMICHAEL\nTom isn't going to sit in with us,\nJohnny.  He only handles specific\nareas of the family business.  Tom?\n\nHAGEN\nSure, Mikey.\n\nHe gathers up some of his papers, as the three men remain\nsilent, waiting for him to go before they talk.  It's clear\nTom doesn't want to be excluded.\n\nHAGEN\nIf you need anything, just...\n\nMICHAEL\nJust tell Rocco I'm waiting.\n\nHagen nods and leaves.  As soon as the door closes:\n\nOLA\nI just left our friend in Miami.\n\nMICHAEL\nHow is his health?\n\nOLA\nNot good.\n\nMICHAEL\nIs there anything I can do; anything\nI can send?\n\nOLA\nHe appreciates your concern,\nMichael, and your respect.\n\nThere's a KNOCK on the door; a moment, and then Rocco\nquietly enters and takes his place without disturbing the\nconversation.\n\nOLA\nThe hotel's registered owners are\none Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney\nBarclay, both Beverly Hills\nattorneys.  In reality it's split\nbetween the Old Lakeville Road\nGroup from Cleveland, and our\nfriend in Miami.  He takes care of\nothers outside the country, you\nknow who I mean.  Meyer Klingman\nruns the store, and does all right,\nbut I've been instructed to tell\nyou, that if you move him out, our\nfriend in Miami will go along with\nyou.\n\nMICHAEL\n\n\n\nHe's very kind, tell him it's\nappreciated.  I'm sure it will be\nprofitable all the way around.\n\nOLA\nHe always makes money for his\npartners.  One by one, our old\nfriends are gone.  Death, natural\nor not, prison, deported.  Our\nfriend in Miami is the only one\nleft, because he always made money\nfor his partners.\n\nThe door opens suddenly, and standing there in his white\nCommunion suit, is Michael's boy Anthony.  A moment later,\nKay appears, and takes the boy's hand.\n\nKAY\nAnthony, Daddy's busy.\n\nMICHAEL\n(rising)\n\nThis is my boy, and my wife.  Mr.\nJohn Ola of Miami.\n\nKAY\nI'm sorry, Michael.  Senator\nGeary's here, and Mr. and Mrs.\nBarrett wanted to thank you before\nthey left.  Won't you join us, Mr.\nOla?\n\nMICHAEL\nMr. Ola's just leaving, Kay.\nPlease tell the Senator I won't be\na minute.\n\nPause; she stands there a moment.\n\nMICHAEL\n(continuing)\n\nKay.\n\nKAY\nYes, Michael.\n\nEXT.

We do each other\nfavors.\n\nAUGUSTINO\n(Sicilian)\n (while he works)\n\nMy boy is studying the flute.  He\nplays very well.  He helps me at\nnight so we can buy him a silver\nflute someday.  Now he has one made\nof wood.  Carmine...play...play for\nmy friends.\n\nVIEW ON THE BOY\n\nwide-eyed... he shuts off the press; and takes out a shabby\nwooden flute.

WAREHOUSE AREA - NIGHT\n\nTessio and Clemenza quickly load racks of cheap dresses.\n\nVito sits behind the wheel of the truck.  He seems reserved,\nand we get the impression that he is studying every move his\ntwo friends are making.\n\nINT. TENEMENT STAIRS - DAY\n\nClemenza runs up a flight of stairs with an armful of\ndresses.  He knocks on a door, and a pretty HOUSEWIFE answers.\n\nCLEMENZA\n(Sicilian)\n\nLady, I got a bargain on these\ndresses.  Five dollars each.  You\ngotta pay at least fifteen, maybe\ntwenty in a store.  Look at them,\nfirst class.\n\nHe holds the dresses up and the woman seems interested.  She\nhandles a couple of them and stands aside so Clemenza can\nenter her apartment.\n\nWOMAN\n(Sicilian)\n\nI don't know which one I like best.\n\nShe holds the dresses against her body, Clemenza approving\nof each one; and then she goes to her purse and takes out\nfive singles and gives them to him.\n\nCLEMENZA\n(Sicilian)\n\nYou'd look beautiful in all of\nthese.  You should buy at least two.\n\nWOMAN\n(Sicilian)\n\nAre you kidding?  My husband will\nkill me if he knows I paid five\ndollars for one dress.\n\nShe holds one up, then another.  She is torn.  Clemenza\nshakes his head and straightens the dress on her body.  His\nhand brushes her arm; she looks at him smiling.\n\nCLEMENZA\n(Sicilian)\n\nYou can have two for five.\n\nShe smiles back.\n\nEXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - DAY\n\nClemenza jumps down the stairs, and out to the middle of the\nstreet, where Vito and Tessio are waiting in the car with\nsome of the stock.\n\nTESSIO\n(Sicilian)\n\nWhat took so long?\n\nCLEMENZA\n\n\n\n(Sicilian)\nShe couldn't decide.\n\nTessio and Clemenza each take more armsful of dresses and\ndivide the neighborhood.\n\nCLEMENZA\n(Sicilian)\n\nVito, take the rest of the stock\nover to Dandine's warehouse; he'll\nmove it to a wholesaler.\n\nThe three part.  Vito drives the truck off.\n\nMOVING VIEW\n\nVito drives the truck through the downtown streets; he turns\na corner and stops for a light.\n\nSuddenly, to his left, he sees the formidable figure of\nFanucci.\n\nHe grabs young Corleone by the shoulder.\n\nCLOSE VIEW ON FANUCCI\n\nfrightening, revealing the large circular scar, now healed.\n\nFANUCCI\n(Sicilian)\n\nAhhh, young fellow.  People tell me\nyou're rich, you and your two\nfriends.  Yet, you don't show\nenough respect to send a few\ndresses to my home.  You know I\nhave three daughters.\n\nVito says nothing.  Fanucci thumbs through the stock.\n\nFANUCCI\n(Sicilian)\n\nThis is my neighborhood.  You and\nyour friends have to show me a\nlittle respect, ah?  This truck you\nhijacked was in my neighborhood.\nYou should let me wet my beak a\nlittle.\n\nFanucci takes a few of the dresses.\n\nFANUCCI\n(Sicilian)\n\nI understand each of you cleared\naround six hundred dollars.  I\nexpect two hundred dollars for my\nprotection and I'll forget the\ninsult.  After all, young people\ndon't know the courtesies due a man\nlike myself.\n\nVito smiles at him and nods.\n\nFANUCCI\n(Sicilian)\n\nOtherwise the police will come to\nsee you and your wife and children\nwill be dishonored and destitute.\nOf course, if my information as to\nyour gains is incorrect, I'll dip\n\n\n\nmy beak just a little.  Just a\nlittle, but no less than one\nhundred dollars, and don't try to\ndeceive me, eh paisan?\n\nVITO\n(Sicilian)\n (quietly)\n\nMy two friends have my share of the\nmoney.  I'll have to speak to them\nafter we deliver these to the\nwholesaler.\n\nFANUCCI\n(Sicilian)\n\nYou tell your friends I expect them\nto let me wet my beak in the same\nmanner.  Don't be afraid to tell\nthem.  Clemenza and I know each\nother well, he understands these\nthings.  Let yourself be guided by\nhim.  He has more experience in\nthese matters.\n\nVITO\n(Sicilian)\n (shrugging innocently)\n\nYou must understand, this is all\nnew to me...\n\nFANUCCI\n(Sicilian)\n\nI understand...\n\nVITO\n(Sicilian)\n\nBut thank you for speaking to me as\na Godfather.\n\nFANUCCI\n(Sicilian)\n (impressed)\n\nYou're a good fellow.\n\nHe takes Vito's hands and clasps them in his own.\n\nFANUCCI\n(Sicilian)\n\nYou have respect.  A fine thing in\nthe young.  Next time, speak to me\nfirst, eh?  Perhaps I can help you\nmake your plans.\n\nFanucci turns with the dresses draped over his arms, waving\nto Vito.\n\nVito throws the truck in gear, and drives off.\n\nCLOSE VIEW ON VITO\n\nWe know that throughout this encounter he has seethed with\nan icy rage.\n\nINT. VITO'S APARTMENT - MED. VIEW - NIGHT\n\nHe wife serves a dinner for her husband and his two friends.\nThey discuss Fanucci as they eat.\n\nTESSIO\n\n\n\n(Sicilian)\nDo you think he'd be satisfied with\nthe two hundred dollars?  I think\nhe would.\n\nCLEMENZA\n(Sicilian)\n\nThat scar-faced bastard will find\nout what we got from the wholesaler.\nHe won't take a dime less than\nthree hundred dollars.\n\nTESSIO\n(Sicilian)\n\nWhat if we don't pay?\n\nCLEMENZA\n(Sicilian)\n (gestures, it's hopeless)\n\nYou know his friends...real animals.\nAnd his connections with the police.\nSure he'd like us to tell him our\nplans so he can set us up for the\ncops and earn their gratitude.\nThen they would owe him a favor;\nthat's how he operates.  We'll have\nto pay.  Three hundred, are we\nagreed?\n\nTESSIO\n(Sicilian)\n\nWhat can we do?\n\nClemenza doesn't even bother checking for Vito's opinion.\n\nCLEMENZA\n(Sicilian)\n\nThey say Fanucci has a license from\nMaranzalla himself to work this\nneighborhood.\n\nVITO\n(Sicilian)\n\nIf you like, why not give me fifty\ndollars each to pay Fanucci.  I\nguarantee he will accept that\namount from me.\n\nTESSIO\n(Sicilian)\n\nWhen Fanucci says two hundred he\nmeans two hundred.  You can't talk\nwith him.\n\nVITO\n(Sicilian)\n\nI'll reason with him.  Leave\neverything in my hands.  I'll\nsettle this problem to your\nsatisfaction.\n\nTessio and Clemenza regard him suspiciously.\n\nVITO\n(Sicilian)\n\nI never lie to people I've accepted\nas my friends.  Speak to Fanucci\nyourself tomorrow.  Let him ask you\nfor the money, but don't pay it,\n\n\n\nand don't in any way quarrel with\nhim.  Tell him you have to get the\nmoney and will send me as your\nmessenger.  Let him understand that\nyou're willing to pay what he asks,\ndon't bargain.  I'll go to his\nhouse, and quarrel with him.  He\nlikes me; enjoys explaining how\nthings are here.  He uses ten\nsentences when he only needs one,\nso while he talks, I'll kill him.\n\nClemenza, irritated, makes a large belch, and washes his\nfood down with wine.\n\nCLEMENZA\n(Sicilian)\n\nVitone!\n(to Tessio)\n\nOur driver has drunk too much wine.\n\nTESSIO\n(Sicilian)\n (laughs at himself)\n\nHe's going to kill Fanucci.\n\nCLEMENZA\n(Sicilian)\n (stern)\n\nThen, after that, what?  Joe\n'Little Knife' Pisani; Willie\nBufalino, maybe, Mr. Maranzalla\nhimself, c'mon!\n\nVITO\n(Sicilian)\n\nFanucci is not connected; he is\nalone.\n\nCLEMENZA\n(Sicilian)\n (sarcastically)\n\nWhat?  You read it in the papers?\n\nVITO\n(Sicilian)\n\nThis man informs to the police;\nthis man allows his vengeance to be\nbought off... No, he is alone.\n\nTESSIO\n(Sicilian)\n\nIf you're wrong...\n\nVITO\n(Sicilian)\n\nIf I'm wrong, they will kill me.\n\nBoth Clemenza and Tessio are impressed with their young\nfriend; his willingness to risk his life on his perception\nof the situation.\n\nEXT. NEW YORK STREET - MED. VIEW - NIGHT\n\nA ten piece Italian street band plays in front of the church\nto commemorate the first night of the Festa di San Gennaro.\nPeople swarm in crowds, delighted by the music, as out of\nthe church four men carry the statue of San Gennaro down to\nthe street.\n\n\n\nMOVING VIEW\n\nClemenza moves along the booths that have been set up along\nthe street: sausage cooking on an open fire; pork livers and\nsweetbeards.  He stops for a sandwich, and makes an irritated\ngesture when the vendor expects to be paid.  He crosses to a\nchurch-sponsored booth with a great Wheel of Fortune, and\nslaps a dollar on a number.  Standing next to him is Vito;\nthey embrace.\n\nCLEMENZA\n(Sicilian)\n (quietly)\n\nAll three daughters are at church;\nhe is alone.  It's important that\nyou let his neighbors see you leave.\nTessio has broken the latch on the\nskylight of his building.\n\nThe wheel stops; they both lose.\n\nCLEMENZA\n(English)\n\nSee, Brother Carmello, even the\nchurch makes numbers.\n\nPRIEST\n(English)\n\nIt's only the way we collect that's\ndifferent.\n\nVito has left while Clemenza jokes with the Priest.\n\nEXT. FESTA STREET - NIGHT\n\nVito passes the booths of food, crossing toward a small and\ndark club.\n\nINT. SOCIAL CLUB - NIGHT\n\nWe can still HEAR the crowds and music of the festa.  Vito\nenters; the club is empty, except for the large white figure\nsitting alone at a small table.  Fanucci barely acknowledges\nVito as he joins him.\n\nWithout a word, Vito counts out two hundred dollars on the\ntable.  Fanucci looks, then takes off his fedora and puts it\non the table over the money.\n\nFANUCCI\n(Sicilian)\n\nI think there's only two hundred\ndollars under my hat.\n\n(he peeks)\nI'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.\n\nVITO\n(Sicilian)\n\nI'm a little short.  I've been out\nof work.  Let me owe you the money\nfor a few weeks.\n\nFANUCCI\n(Sicilian)\n\nAh, you're a sharp young fellow.\nHow is it I've never noticed you\nbefore\n\n(he takes the two\n\n\n\nhundred and pours\nsome wine for Vito)\n\nYou're too quiet for your own\ninterest.  I could find some work\nfor you to do that would be very\nprofitable.\n\n(he rises)\nNo hard feelings, eh?  If I can\never do you a service let me know.\nYou've done a good job for yourself\ntonight.\n\nEXT. FESTA STREET - MED. VIEW - NIGHT\n\nBy now the musicians have left, but still families are\nwalking the street, and stopping at the booths.\n\nFanucci stands there a moment; he is known by everyone, and\nconsiders himself highly loved.\n\nThen Fanucci begins the walk through the festa, on his way\nhome.\n\nEXT. ROOFTOPS - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT\n\nVito silently moves along the rooftop; paralleling Fanucci's\nwalk.\n\nWe HEAR the sounds of the festa, and every so often catch a\nglimpse of the patterned lights, and the crowds below.\n\nEXT. FESTA STREETS - MOVING VIEW ON FANUCCI - NIGHT\n\nwalking through the crowded streets.  The statue of San\nGennaro is arranged in some midnight religious ceremony.\n\nThe VIEW LIFTS UP, to the rooftops.\n\nEXT.

THE STREETS - NIGHT\n\nThe procession in the streets is preceded by ten altar boys;\nand the glittering Monstrance, something of an altar carried\nout into the streets.\n\nThe priest begins this nocturnal service, as the crowds in\nthe street kneel down in prayer.\n\nINT. FANUCCI'S BUILDING - NIGHT\n\nFanucci unlocks the door to his building; we can HEAR the\nservices in the background.\n\nEXT. THE ROOFTOP - NIGHT\n\nVito tries the trap door on the roof; it is stuck firmly\nshut; despite Clemenza's instructions.  He struggles with\nit, but no luck.\n\nFrom the distance, the Choir begins to Latin.  Vito moves\naround the skylight, to an identical trap, tries this one;\nit opens.\n\nEXT. THE MONSTRANCE - MED. VIEW ON THE PRIEST - NIGHT\n\n\n\nperforming the services in Latin.  The ten altar boys are in\nattendance.\n\nEXT. THE ROOFTOP - NIGHT\n\nVito reaches down into the trap, and pulls out the newly\noiled gun that has been left for him.  He slides down into\nthe building.\n\nINT. FANUCCI'S HALLWAY - DOWN ANGLE - NIGHT\n\nFanucci proceeds up the staircase with loud, heavy steps.\nAn OLD WOMAN on one of the flights sees him, and immediately\nmoves to her apartment.\n\nFANUCCI\n(Sicilian)\n\nWhat's the matter, Signora?  You\ndon't say 'good evening'?\n\nWOMAN\n(Sicilian)\n\n'Good evening,' Signor Fanucci.\n\nShe quickly disappears behind her door.  Fanucci laughs,\ncontinues up, singing to himself.  The MASS outside is\nalways in evidence.\n\nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nVito climbs down from the attic, and finds Fanucci's rear\ndoor open.  He slips in, and makes his way past the open\nwindows, out of which pour the music and chanting of the\nMass.  Slowly and quietly he pulls them down, shut.\n\nHe moves quietly to a glass door, and peeks out.\n\nWHAT HE SEES:\n\nThree young women, Fanucci's DAUGHTERS, laughing and talking.\n\nVIEW ON VITO\n\nA slip up.  Tessio had said they were out.  He steps outside\nto the alley where he can look into the apartment.\n\nANOTHER VIEW\n\nFanucci opens the door of his apartment, and enters.\n\nCLOSE VIEW ON VITO\n\nHe begins to wrap the gun.\n\nVIEW ON THE DAUGHTERS\n\nTheir father greets them with a kiss; and a little religious\ngift he has bought for each.\n\nCLOSE ON THE GUN\n\nwrapped in this primitive method of a silencer.  The VIEW\nTILTS to Vito, caught in the dilemma of having to kill all\nor none of them.  Then something catches his eye.\n\nWHAT HE SEES:\n\nA small gray alley cat is attracted to the young man, comes\n\n\n\nup to him and rubs itself against him.  Vito rubs the\nanimal, speaking softly in Sicilian, then, gaining its\nconfidence, lifts it up and carefully lets it into Fanucci's\napartment.\n\nHe steps back, holding the gun.  We HEAR some Italian\nshouted in the house; a loud sound from the cat, and some of\nthe thumping footsteps of Fanucci.\n\nVIEW ON VITO\n\nholding the wrapped gun, waiting.\n\nWHAT HE SEES:\n\nThe white blob of Fanucci opening the door and cursing in\nItalian as he throws the cat out.\n\nVIEW ON VITO\n\nsqueezing the trigger; the muffled, but still LOUD BLAST\nresounding in the building.\n\nVIEW ON FANUCCI\n\nHe holds onto the door frame, trying to stand erect, trying\nto reach for his gun.  The force of his struggle has torn\nthe buttons off his jacket and made it swing loose.  His gun\nis exposed but so is a spidery vein on the white shirtfront\nof his stomach.  Carefully, as if plunging a needle into\nthis vein, Vito Corleone fires a second bullet.\n\nFanucci falls to his knees, propping the door open, giving a\nterrible groan.  We begin to hear the VOICES of girls inside\nthe apartment.\n\nVito quickly opens his wallet, removes the two hundred,\nquickly fires one last bullet into Fanucci's sweaty cheek.\nNow the towel the gun was wrapped with catches fire,\nliterally on Vito's hand; quickly he throws it to the\nground, stamps it out...and disappears upward.\n\nEXT. THE ROOFTOPS - MED. VIEW - NIGHT\n\nVito moves like a cat along the rooftops; we HEAR the\nconclusion of the Mass down below.\n\nCLOSE ON VITO\n\nPausing; we can SEE the great spectacle of lights and\ncandles on the streets below.\n\nHe empties the gun of bullets and smashes the barrel against\nthe side of the roof ledge.  He reverses it in his hand, and\nbreaks the butt into two separate halves against the chimney.\nHe smashes it again, and the pistol breaks into barrel and\nhandle, two separate pieces.\n\nHe then moves along the rooftop, dropping the two separate\nfragments into various air shafts.\n\nEXT. THE STREET PROCESSION - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT\n\nThe Priest, having completed the ceremony, follows as the\nMonstrance is carried off through the streets, as the Choir\nsings.\n\nEXT.

Some of the\nmen drink wine poured out of a pitcher; we can still HEAR\nthe music and night sounds of the Festa.\n\nA neighbor is singing a Neapolitan song.\n\nQuietly, without a word, and with only a momentary glance\nfrom his wife, Vito joins the little group; takes a glass of\nwine, and listens to the song.\n\nCLOSE VIEW ON VITO\n\nlistening to the song.  He reaches out and takes the small\nhand of his son.\n\nVITO\n(Sicilian)\n\nSantino, your papa loves you.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT. ANTHONY'S TAHOE ROOM - NIGHT\n\nThe room is large, lit from the outside by a bright evening.\nWe can see the outline of many toys on the shelves built\nalong the wall.  We see the dark figure of Michael Corleone\nenter the room and approach the bed where his son Anthony\nlies curled in messy blankets.  Michael quietly arranges his\nsmall hands and feet and covers the little boy.  Suddenly,\nAnthony turns, his eyes open.  He is staring, perfectly\nawake, at his father.\n\nMICHAEL\nCan't you sleep?\n\nNo answer.\n\nMICHAEL\nAre you alright?\n\nANTHONY\nYes.\n\nMICHAEL\nDid you like your party?\n\nANTHONY\nI got lots of presents.\n\nMICHAEL\nDo you like them?\n\nANTHONY\nI didn't know the people who gave\nthem to me.\n\n\n\nMICHAEL\nThey were friends.\n\nHe kisses his boy, and then turns.\n\nANTHONY\nDid you see my present for you?\n\nMICHAEL\nNo, where is it?\n\nANTHONY\nOn your pillow.\n\nMICHAEL\nI'm leaving very early tomorrow,\nbefore you wake up.\n\nANTHONY\nI know.  How long will you be gone?\n\nMICHAEL\nJust a few days.\n\nANTHONY\nWill you take me?\n\nMICHAEL\nI can't.\n\nANTHONY\nWhy do you have to go?\n\nMICHAEL\nTo do business.\n\nANTHONY\nI can help you.\n\nMICHAEL\nSome day you will.\n\nMichael kisses him again.\n\nINT. MICHAEL-KAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nThe room is lit from a small night lamp on Michael's side of\nthe large bed.\n\nKay is huddled in blankets, asleep.  Michael closes the door\nto his room, moves to his side of the bed, and glances down\nto the pillow.\n\nVIEW ON THE PILLOW\n\nis a child's drawing of a long limousine, with a man in a\nhat sitting in the back seat.\n\nAn arrow pointing to him is marked \"DAD.\" Under it, a nine\nyear old's handwriting says: \"Do you like it?  Check YES __\nI liked it or NO __ I didn't like it.\" Michael turns,\nlooking for a pencil, and moves to the dresser, where he\nplaces a check next to \"YES.\"\n\nHe starts to cross back toward his side of the bed, when Kay\nturns, almost in her sleep:\n\nKAY\n\n\n\nMichael?  Why are the drapes open?\n\nHis eyes dart back to the curved, beautifully leaded windows\nof the room.  The DRAPES are opened.  Then, without a\nsecond's hesitation, he leaps to the floor, still holding\nhis son's drawing, as a spray of machine gun bullets sweep\nacross the windows; glass shattering all over the room.\n\nKay screams out; rising, still half-asleep.  Michael crawls\ntoward her, and pulls her down to the floor to him.\n\nThen, for a moment, there is silence, soon filled by the\nshouts of men; as flashes of light sweep by the window, as\nguards with flashlights come running.\n\nMichael holds Kay to him, knowing they have both survived,\nand then gently:\n\nMICHAEL\nGo with the kids.\n\nEXT. THE TAHOE ESTATE - NIGHT\n\nSuddenly, the great floodlights are turned on, bathing lawns\nin an intense blue light.\n\nGroups of ordinarily dressed security men drawn in from all\ndirections; a state of confusion prevails.

MAIN GATE AND KENNELS - NIGHT\n\nThe character of the summer estate has changed: bright\nfloodlights illuminate the main points of entry: the main\ngate; the waterway; the stone wall that encompasses the\nestate on all sides.\n\nSeveral men with flashlights reinforce the guard at the main\ngate.\n\nFULL VIEW\n\nOff in the distance, we see another group of men with\nflashlights combing the waterline.

MICHAEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nKay, the children, and some women servants have come down\nfrom the various rooms into the central living area, that\ncan be most easily secured.  The little girl is still\nasleep; they make you think of an immigrant family, with\ntheir blankets and frightened faces, all waiting in a\ncentral room.\n\nMichael goes up to Kay, squeezes her hand, and whispers:\n\nMICHAEL\nIt will be all right.  We were lucky.\n\nShe says nothing; but her face expresses the anger she feels\nover the jeopardy Michael has placed his children in.  She\nholds her young daughter in her arms.\n\nThe door opens, and Rocco enters.  He quickly realizes he is\nholding his gun in plain view in front of the family, and\nputs it away.  Michael moves to him, and they talk a distance\naway from Kay.\n\nROCCO\nYour family all seem to be okay in\nthe other houses; your Mother's\nstill sleeping.\n\nMICHAEL\nAnd?\n\nROCCO\nNo sign of them yet; but they're\nstill on the Estate.\n\nWe HEAR loud shouting from outside.\n\nDEANNA (O.S.)\nGoddamn you!

TAHOE ESTATE - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT\n\nMichael walks the short distance from his house, to the\nboathouse where he conducts his business away from his family.\n\nA small group of bodyguards, carrying machine guns, make the\nwalk with him from all sides, a respectful distance away.\nIt gives the appearance of a lonely President moving in his\ncompound, followed by teams of Secret Service men.\n\nThe boathouse is already secured by teams of men, hastily\nwakened from their lodge house; a barracks-like structure\nwhere reinforcements are lodged just for this kind of\nemergency.\n\nFULL VIEW\n\nIn the distance, we can see the teams of men and dogs, with\ntheir lights, guns and shouts, combing every inch of the\nestate.\n\nINT.

He moves to a walk-in\nsafe, quickly runs through the combination, and opens it.\nHe takes out an envelope, and puts it into his pocket;\nthere's a KNOCK on the door, and Hagen enters.

TAHOE BOATHOUSE - NIGHT\n\nMichael talks intimately to Tom.\n\nMICHAEL\nThere's a lot I can't tell you, Tom.\nI know that's upset you in the\npast; and you've felt that it was\nbecause of some lack of trust or\nconfidence.  But it is because I do\ntrust you that I've kept so much\nsecret from you.  It's precisely\nthat at this moment, you are the\nonly one that I can completely\ntrust.  In time, you'll understand\neverything.\n\nHAGEN\n(nods with this statement)\n\nBut your people... Neri... Rocco;\nyou don't think...\n\nMICHAEL\nNo, I have confidence in their\nloyalty... but this is life and\ndeath, and Tom, you are my brother.\n\nHagen in very moved.\n\nHAGEN\nMikey, I hoped...\n\nMICHAEL\nNo Tom, just listen.  All my people\nare businessmen; their loyalty is\nbased on that.  One thing I learned\nfrom my father is to try to think\nas the people around you think...and\non that basis, anything is possible.\nFredo has a good heart, but he is\nweak...and stupid, and stupid\npeople are the most dangerous of\nall.  I've kept you out of things,\nTom, because I've always known that\nyour instincts were legitimate, and\nI wanted you to know very little of\nthings that would make you an\naccomplice, for your own protection.\nI never blamed you for the setbacks\nthe family took under Sonny; I know\nyou were in a position of limited\npower, and you did your best to\nadvise and caution him.  What I am\nsaying is that now, for how long I\ndo not know, you will be the Don.\nIf what I think has happened is\n\n\n\ntrue; I will leave tonight, and\nabsolutely no one will know how to\ncontact me.  And even you are not\nto try to reach me unless it is\nabsolutely necessary.  I give you\ncomplete power: over Neri... Fredo,\neveryone.  I am trusting you with\nthe lives of my wife and children,\nand the future of this family,\nsolely resting on your judgment and\ntalent.\n\nVIEW ON HAGEN\n\nA man who has steadily declined over the last five years,\nrealizing that total power and responsibility is being\nplaced on him.\n\nMICHAEL\n(continuing)\n\n...But Tom, you must know that I do\nthis only because I believe you are\nthe only one who is capable of\ntaking over for me.\n\nVIEW ON MICHAEL\n\ntaking out the envelope.\n\nMICHAEL\nI've prepared this; have had it for\nover a month.  It won't explain\neverything; but indicates where I\nwill be, so in a sense, it is my\nlife.\n\n(he hands the envelope\nto Hagen)\n\nAlso, there are three tasks that\nmust be executed immediately.  Pop\nwould have given those to Luca --\nYou knew Pop as well as anyone, act\nas though you were him.  It\ndiscusses Kay as well; that will be\nthe most difficult.  The men who\ntried to kill me tonight, will\nnever leave the estate.\n\nHAGEN\nWill we...be able to get who\nordered it out of them?\n\nMICHAEL\nI don't think so.  Unless I'm very\nwrong...they're already dead.\nKilled by someone inside...very\nfrightened that they botched it.\nThat's why I am going to disappear\nin a few minutes, and leave\neverything to you.\n\nHAGEN\nBut if you're wrong...\n\nMICHAEL\nIf I'm wrong...\n\nThere is a KNOCK on the door.\n\nMICHAEL\n\n\n\n...I don't think I'm wrong.\n(he indicates the knock)\n\nYes.\n\nThe door opens; it is Rocco; Michael rises, after making a\nknowing glance toward Tom, and moves to talk quietly to a\nfrightened and agitated Rocco.\n\nEXT. STONE WALL AND STREAM - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT\n\nA group of men with flashlights and guns lead Michael, Tom\nand Rocco to the stone bridge spanning the stream which runs\nthrough the estate.\n\nLOW CLOSE VIEW\n\nMichael's dispassionate face, looking down.  THE VIEW MOVES\nto Hagen's, and then down to the murky water under the\nbridge, where we see the bodies of three strangers, lying in\nthe moving water; machine-type guns nearby, with their\nthroats cut.  Light from the many flashlights illuminates\nthe grotesque scene.\n\nMICHAEL (O.S.)\nFish them out.\n\nSeveral of the men wade down into the stream; Rocco helps,\nand even Tom steps down to get a better look at who they\nwere.  They are total strangers; Rocco examines the type of\nguns they used.\n\nWhen they climb back onto the ground, Michael is gone.\nEveryone notices it, but no one says anything.\n\nHagen stands there, holding the envelope Michael had given\nhim in his hand.\n\nHe realizes that now, he is the DON.\n\nHAGEN\nGet rid of the bodies.  Tomorrow\nmorning I want a report made to the\nlocal police, and paper, that some\nexplosives we keep on the property\nwere accidentally ignited.\n\nThe men respond; Hagen makes the lonely walk back to the\nlighted section of the compound, which now resembles a\nprison camp.\n\nFADE OUT.\n\nFADE IN:\n\nINT. STATE SENATE FLOOR - DAY\n\nThe Senate is in session; Senator Geary is on the floor\nduring a vote.  An aide approaches him, with a slip of paper.\n\nINT.

No strings.\n\nSENATOR GEARY\nNo strings.\n\nHAGEN\nYou know there's a Senate\nInvestigating Committee recently\nset up; we thought it would be\nunfortunate if they were to trace\nanything though-provoking to your\nname.\n\nSENATOR GEARY\nNo one can trace anything to me; I\npride myself on that.\n\nHAGEN\nDo you gamble?\n\nSENATOR GEARY\nA little; what's so thought-\nprovoking about that?\n\nHAGEN\nDo you owe markers?\n\nSENATOR GEARY\nMaybe two, three thousand dollars.\n\nHagen leans forward, and deposits a handful of paper on the\nSenator's desk.\n\nHAGEN\nThe Corleone family has paid them\noff for you...as an expression of\nour esteem.\n\nGeary quickly looks through the paid markers.\n\nSENATOR GEARY\nThere's thirty grand worth of paid\noff markers -- I never owed that\nmuch.\n\nHAGEN\nOur mistake.  But what does it\nmatter; it was our money.\n\n(rising)\nWe don't even expect thanks.\n\nSENATOR GEARY\n\n\n\nYou paid off thirty grand I never\nowed.\n\nHAGEN\nWe'll keep it quiet; the people who\nknow are trustworthy...the Committee\nneedn't find out.\n\nSENATOR GEARY\nAnd what's the price of their not\nfinding out.\n\nHAGEN\nSimple.  Be friendly like us.  Not\nhostile.\n\nSENATOR GEARY\n(he despises Hagen)\n\nThanks...friend.\n\nEXT.

We're\nnot to let you through.\n\nKAY\n(disbelieving)\n\nI'm going to the market.\n\nMAN\nIf you could just give us a list,\nwe'll pick up anything you want.\n\nKAY\nWhose orders are these?\n\nMAN\nMr. Hagen's, ma'am.\n\nWe notice Hagen walking to them in the background.\n\nHAGEN\nKay.\n\nVIEW THROUGH THE GATE\n\nHagen approaches the car; Kay gets out so they can talk away\nfrom the children.\n\nHAGEN\nI wanted to explain this myself...\n\n\n\nI had business in Carson City.\n\nHe walks with her a little way from the others; the children\nrun out of the station wagon, and start to play.\n\nHAGEN\nIt's Michael's request...for your\nsafety.  We can send out for\nanything you need.\n\nKAY\nI'm supposed to stay in my house.\n\nHAGEN\nWithin the compound will be fine.\n\nKAY\nI was supposed to take the children\nto New England next week.\n\nHAGEN\nThat's off now.\n\nKAY\nI'm going to see my parents.\n\nHAGEN\nKay, Michael didn't tell me a lot;\nand what he did tell me, I can't\nrepeat.  But the responsibility for\nyou and the kids was the most\nimportant thing he left me with.\n\nKAY\nHow long does this go on?\n\nHAGEN\nI don't know.\n\n(pause)\nI'm sorry, Kay...\n\nKAY\nAm I a prisoner?\n\nHAGEN\nThat's not the way we look at it.\n\nAngrily, without another word, Kay turns away from him, and\nwalks to her children, ignoring the running station wagon.\n\nEXT.

SUBURBAN MIAMI NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY\n\nOla's car leads Michael's through a middle-class suburban\narea of $30,000 to $40,000 homes.  There are small channels\nwith sporting and fishing boats parked near the houses.\nOla's car pulls up in front of a very simple, tract-type\nhome.  Michael's car parks nearby.\n\nMICHAEL\n(Sicilian)\n (to Bussetta)\n\nYou'll wait in the car.\n\nOla has gotten out of his car and walks up the little path\nto the front door.  Michael waits.\n\nOla rings the bell, and after a moment, a rather pretty,\nmiddle-aged WOMAN answers, remaining behind the screen door.\n\n\n\nOla says a few things to her and she disappears, leaving the\ndoor open.\n\nOla comes down the steps, looks at Michael, nodding to him.\nOla then gets into his car and drives off.

HYMAN ROTH'S DEN - DAY\n\nMichael enters the den: it's very comfortable, but somewhat\nlike a senior citizen's retirement home in Florida.\n\nMICHAEL'S VIEW\n\nThere, sitting before the television is a small man in his\nmiddle sixties, thin, with a wizened face, looking like a\nsmall-time retired Jewish businessman.  This is HYMAN ROTH.\n\nROTH\nSit down, this is almost over.  You\nfollow the baseball games?\n\nMICHAEL\nNot for a few years.\n\nROTH\nI like sporting events -- I really\nenjoy watching them in the afternoon.\nOne of the things I love about this\ncountry.  I loved baseball ever\nsince Arnold Rothstein fixed the\nWorld Series of 1919...I heard you\nhad some trouble.\n\nMICHAEL\nYes.\n\nROTH\n\n\n\nWhat a mistake; people behaving\nlike that, with guns.\n\n(he shakes his head)\nIt was my understanding we left all\nthat behind.  But, let me tell you,\nthe important thing is that you're\nall right.  Good health is the most\nimportant thing; more than success;\nmore than power; more than money.\n\nMICHAEL\nThe incident of the other night is\na nuisance that I can take care of.\nI came to you because I want\nnothing to affect our agreement; I\nwanted to clear everything I'm\ngoing to do with you, just in case.\n\nROTH\nYou're a considerate young man.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou're a great man, Mr. Roth, I\nhave much to learn from you.\n\nROTH\n(warmly)\n\nHowever I can help you...\n\nMICHAEL\nThe Rosato Brothers have performed\nservices for you in the past; I\nunderstand that they are under your\nprotection.\n\nROTH\n(simply)\n\nWe do favors for each other...\n\nMICHAEL\nTechnically, they are still under\nthe Clemenza wing of the Corleone\nFamily, now run by Frankie\nPentangeli.  After Clemenza died,\nthe Rosatos wanted territory of\ntheir own.  Pentangeli refused, and\ncame to me, asking for permission\nto eliminate them.  I, of course,\nknew of their relationship with\nyou, and in gratitude for your help\nwith the Tropicana matter, turned\nhim down.  Pentangeli was furious,\nand paid one hundred and fifty\nthousand dollars to have me killed.\nI was lucky and he was stupid.\nI'll visit him soon.\n\n(leaning toward the\nold man, sincerely)\n\nThe important thing is that nothing\njeopardize our plans, yours and\nmine.

I must choose his\nreplacement: it cannot be Rosato.\n\nROTH\nOf course you must keep control of\nyour family.\n\nHe turns to Michael, turning the volume higher on the\ntelevision, and moving closer to his young partner.\n\nROTH\nMichael, these things are\nunimportant.  Who should be the\nmanager of a dime store, Joe or\nJack?  Unimportant.  You do what\nyou think is right.  You're a young\nman, and I'm old and sick.  What we\ndo together in the next few months\nwill be history, Michael; it has\nnever been done before.  We will do\nthis historical thing together, and\neven your Father could never dream\nit would be possible.  We are\nbigger than U.S. Steel, you and\nme... because in America, anything\nis possible!\n\n(pause)\nBut soon I will be dead, and it\nwill all belong to you.\n\nThere is a KNOCK on the door, and Terri Roth pushes the door\nopen with her hip.\n\nTERRI\nMy goodness, you'll rupture your\neardrums, Hyman.\n\nShe puts the tray down, and turns down the television.\n\nEXT.

You're making big\ntrouble, Carmine.\n\nROSATO\nYou weren't straight with us,\nFrankie, what else could we do?\n\nPENTANGELI\nWe could have talked first, saved a\nlot of running around.\n\nROSATO\nYou wasn't listening, you didn't\nwant to talk.\n\nPENTANGELI\nDon't I look like I'm listening?\n\nROSATO\n\n\n\nWe want Brooklyn one hundred\npercent.  No more taxes to you.  We\nwant to be only loosely connected\nwith your family -- sort of a\nunder-family all of our own.  Then\nwe can act on all internal matters\nwithout talking.  Also we want you\nto inform Michael Corleone that we\ncan deal directly with him.\n\nPENTANGELI\nI'm a little hungry, maybe I'll\norder something.  Joe.\n\n(one of his men)\nGet me some bracciole or something.\nAnd pay cash.\n\n(to Rosato)\nAnd in return for these concessions,\nwhat do you do for me?\n\nROSATO\nWe will release the hostages,\nnumber one.  Number two, we're here\nfor you to count on when you need\nus.  We're independent, but we're\nhere if you need us.  In general,\nwe'll cooperate with you and your\nbusinesses, and you in turn will\ncooperate with us.  Pari persu.\n\nPENTANGELI\nPari Persu; what the fuck is Pari\npersu...?\n\nROSATO\nMy lawyer went over this beforehand.\n\nPENTANGELI\nWhat assurances do I have that\nthere will be no more kidnapping,\nno more hits?\n\nROSATO\nThe same assurance we got from you.\n\nPENTANGELI\nWhat if I say shove it?\n\nROSATO\nThen Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue\nDeRosa will need to be fitted for\nslabs.\n\nPENTANGELI\nYou want a war?\n\nROSATO\nWe got no choice.\n\nPENTANGELI\nYou know if there's a way I'll go\nto the commission and the commission\nwill side with me.  That puts me\nand the other New York families\nagainst you.\n\nROSATO\nWe got friends in the commission.\n\n\n\nPENTANGELI\n(getting angry)\n\nI'm talking about Italians!\n\nROSATO\nWhat about Michael Corleone?\n\nPENTANGELI\nHe supports me.\n\nROSATO\nMaybe, yes... maybe no.\n\nOne of Pentangeli's men approaches with a plate of Italian\nfood.\n\nPentangeli stands up, angered by this remark of Rosato's; he\npushes the dish of food out of the surprised Bodyguard's\nhands.\n\nPENTANGELI\nYou drove old Pete Clemenza to his\ngrave, Carmine; you and your\nbrother.  Turning on him; trouble\nin his territories -- you and your\ndemands.  I hold you responsible,\njust as though you shot him in the\nhead.  And I ain't gonna let that\ngo for long!\n\nPentangeli walks out of the restaurant; there's a little\ntension between the bodyguards of the two factions.\n\nROSATO (O.S.)\nHey, Five-Angels...\n\nHe gives him the arm.\n\nFrankie's face turns red, like he wants to have it out here\nand now; but Willy Cicci calms his down, and they all make\ntheir move out.\n\nEXT.

In the same room where\nmy wife was sleeping; where my\nchildren come in their pajamas, and\nplay with their toys.\n\nHe's terrified Pentangeli with his anger; then, just as\nsuddenly, he talks quietly, calmly.\n\nMICHAEL\nI want you to help me take my\nrevenge.\n\nPENTANGELI\nMichael, anything.  What is it I\ncan do for you?\n\nMICHAEL\nI want you to settle these troubles\nwith the Rosato Brothers.\n\n\n\nPENTANGELI\nI was just going to contact you,\nMichael; we just had a 'sit-down' -\nin fact, I just come from there.\n\nMICHAEL\nI want you to settle on their terms.\n\nPENTANGELI\nMike, I don't understand.  Don't\nask me to do that.\n\nMICHAEL\nTrust me; do as I ask.\n\nPENTANGELI\nIt would be the beginning of the\nend for my family.  How can I keep\nall my other territories in like if\nI let two wise-guys stand up and\ndemand this and that, and then give\nit to them?\n\nMICHAEL\nFrankie...do you respect me?  Do I\nhave your loyalty?\n\nPENTANGELI\nAlways... But sometimes I don't\nunderstand.  I know I'll never have\nyour kind of brains, in big deals.\nBut Mike, this is a street thing.\nAnd Hyman Roth in Miami is behind\nthe Rosato Brothers.\n\nMICHAEL\nI know.\n\nPENTANGELI\nThen why do you want me to lay down\nto them?\n\nMICHAEL\n(coldly, but convincing)\n\nFrankie, Roth tried to have me\nkilled.  I'm sure it was him, but I\ndon't know yet why.\n\nPENTANGELI\nJesus Christ, Michael, then let's\nhit 'em now, while we still got the\nmuscle.\n\nMICHAEL\nThis was my father's old study.\nWhen I was a kid, we had to be\nquiet when we played near here.\nWhen I was older, I learned many\nthings from him here.  I was happy\nthat this house never went to\nstrangers; first Clemenza took it\nover, and then you.  My father\ntaught me, in this room, never to\nact until you know everything\nthat's behind things.  Never.  If\nHyman Roth sees that I interceded\nwith you in the Rosato Brothers'\nfavor, he'll think his relationship\nwith me is still sound.  I'm going\n\n\n\nsomewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We\nhave friends in some very important\nbusiness that we're making.  Do\nthis for me; you make the peace\nwith the Rosato Brothers on their\nterms.  Let the word out that I\nforced you; you're not happy wit\nhit, but acquiesced, just because\nof me.  It will get back to Hyman\nRoth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can\ntrust me.\n\nPENTANGELI\nSure, Mike.  I'll go along.\n\nMICHAEL\nGood.\n\nThey embrace; Michael kisses him.  He looks at the young\nDon, thoughtfully.\n\nINT.

You skip Miami, and go\nstraight to Geneva.  It's to be\ndeposited to this number.\n\n(handing him a small envelope)\nAnd it's got to be there by Monday\n\n\n\nmorning, no slip-up.\n\nCOURIER\nI think I was 'picked-up' last trip.\nThat hour layover I had at Kennedy.\nI went over and bought a paper...\n\nNeri has finished putting the 'creamed' money into the pouch.\n\nNERI\nThose were our people.\n\nCOURIER\nOkay, just thought you should know.\n\nHe is just about to close and lock the pouch, when Hagen\ngestures that he should wait, and adds more stacks of\ncarefully packaged bills into the pouch.  Then Neri locks\nit, and handcuffs it to the courier's arm, looking\ninquiringly at Hagen.\n\nHAGEN\nLet them count.\n\nThe courier is shown out through a private door, and then\nthe first door is opened.  Two accountants come in with the\nguards, and the trays are opened, and the counting process\nis begun all over again, this time with the State Tally\nsheets.\n\nINT. TROPICANA CORRIDOR - MOVING VIEW - DAY\n\nThe courier continues on his way; followed by Hagen and Neri.\n\nNERI\nWhat's up?\n\nHAGEN\nNo questions.\n\nNERI\nI got to ask questions, Tom,\nthere's three million dollars cash\nin that pouch; Mike is gone and I\nhave no word from him.\n\nHAGEN\nAl, as far as you're concerned, I'm\nthe Don.\n\nNERI\nHow do I know you haven't gone into\nbusiness for yourself?\n\nThis hurts Tom; but he is a reasonable man, and he knows he\nowes Neri some explanation.\n\nHAGEN\nYou've been through a lot with us\nso I'm going to give you the truth.\nMike knows it was someone within\nthe compound that set him up for\nthat hit.  So nobody is to know\nwhere he is, not you, not Rocco,\nnot even his brother Fredo.  Sorry,\nAl, I know how you feel about\nMike...but he still remembers Tessio.\n\nEXT. KEY WEST - NIGHT\n\n\n\nMichael is led to a desolate, night-lit private dock.  He is\nfollowed by the ever-present Bussetta, and they are helped\nonto a light-weight, luxury cabin cruiser.

TAHOE ESTATE - DAY\n\nA seaplane lands nicely by the private Corleone harbor;\nHagen disembarks with his inevitable overloaded briefcase.\nHe continues down the ramp, past several Buttonmen, dressed\nin summer casual attire, and who resemble secret service men\nrather than thugs.\n\nHis wife THERESA lies on a blanket on the great lawn, with\nher youngest children, who run to their father for a kiss.\n\nTHERESA\nHungry?\n\nHAGEN\nJust a little.\n\nTHERESA\nI've invited Mama, Sandra and the\nkids for barbecue.\n\nHAGEN\nWhat about Kay?\n\nTHERESA\nI couldn't find her.

Is about to knock on the door:\n\nHAGEN'S SON\nHey, Pop, heads up!\n\nThe football is flying in his direction; he catches it and\nthrows it back.  Then he cracks the door open, and peeks in.\n\nINT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nHAGEN\nKay?\n\n\n\nHe steps in, the beautiful summer living room is neat, but\nempty.\n\nHAGEN\nAnyone hungry?\n\nHe moves through the house more quickly; into the dining and\nrecreation room areas.  A cat jumps off a pile of cushions\nand runs across the room.\n\nHAGEN\nHello?\n\nSANDRA (O.S.)\nShe's gone, Tom.\n\nSandra has followed him into Michael's house.\n\nHAGEN\nWhat do you mean gone?\n\nSANDRA\nThe Barretts from Rubicon Bay came\nby in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried\nto say she wasn't in, but Kay\nspotted them and asked if they\nwould take her and the kids for a\nride.  That was three hours ago.\n\nHAGEN\n(furious)\n\nWhy didn't someone tell me!\n\nSANDRA\nI wanted to tell you alone; your\nwife doesn't know what's going on.\n\nHagen rushes out of the house.\n\nEXT. TAHOE LAWN - DAY\n\nHagen moves quickly out of Michael's house; moving across\nthe lawn to the boathouse.\n\nHAGEN'S SON\nHey, Dad!\n\nThis time he ignores the thrown ball, and moves directly to\nRocco, who is by some men near the boathouse.\n\nHAGEN\nRocco!\n\nROCCO\nI know.  I went down to the Barrett\nhouse.  But she's gone.  They drove\nher and the kids to North Tahoe\nairport.\n\nHAGEN\nGoddamn it, where were you?\n\nROCCO\nI was in my house.

And then looks\nup to his men watching him.  He's embarrassed to have shown\nsuch weakness.\n\nHAGEN\nAll right, let me think a minute.\n\nRocco clears the men out.\n\nROCCO\nMe too, Tom?\n\nHAGEN\nYeah, give me a minute.\n\nRocco gone, Hagen moves behind the enormous bar, and pours\nhimself a giant drink.

HAVANA STREET - MOVING VIEW - DAY\n\nMichael and Bussetta are driven in a Mercury sedan, making\nits way through the streets of Havana.\n\nCLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL\n\nlooking out the window.\n\nMICHAEL'S POV\n\nCrowded streets, occasional roving bands playing for the\ntourists; there is much evidence of tourism: Americans\n\n\n\nwalking through the streets with cameras.  Occasionally, we\nsee a Cuban with a row of numbers attached to his hat,\ncarrying a big sheet of the daily lottery numbers.  From all\nof these street impressions, the city is booming with\nactivity, but there is also much evidence of whores and\npimps and little children begging in the streets.\n\nMED. VIEW\n\nThe big American car stops at an intersection.  Bussetta is\nsitting in the forward passenger side; while Michael is in\nthe back.  He hears tapping on the window; he turns and sees\nfour Cuban boys tapping on his window and extending their\nhands, and rubbing their stomachs as though they were hungry.\nThe Cuban driver rolls down his window and shouts them away\nin Spanish.\n\nINT. HAVANA CASINO LOBBY - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT\n\nMichael is led through a beautiful wooden lobby of the\nhotel, done in Spanish style, apparently just recently\ncompleted.  He is approached by a thin, mousy man, SAM ROTH,\nwho ushers him toward the casino entrance.\n\nSAM ROTH\nHiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth.\nWelcome to the Capri; my brother's\nupstairs.  You wanta take a rest\nbefore you see him, or can I get\nyou something, anything at all?\n\nMICHAEL\nNo, I'm fine.\n\nHe leads Michael into the main casino.\n\nSAM ROTH\nThis is it!  We think it makes\nVegas look like the corner crap game.\n\nMICHAEL\nVery impressive.\n\nSAM ROTH\nJake, Jake, come over here.  Mike,\nI want you to meet Jake Cohen; he\nmanages the casino for us.\n\nCOHEN\n(appreciating\nMichael's status)\n\nMr. Corleone.\n\nSam turns to Bussetta and extends his glad-hand.\n\nSAM ROTH\nPleasure to meet you, I'm sure...\n\nHe gets no response whatsoever from Bussetta.\n\nINT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT\n\nAn extremely tall, well-built Cuban, tanned and wearing an\nattractive mustache, LEON, in his middle forties, reads from\na prepared paper.  His sentences are translated by a smaller\nman, standing to his rear.\n\nLEON\n(Spanish)\n\n\n\nMost respected gentlemen, allow me\nto welcome you to the City of\nHavana, the Republic of Cuba on\nbehalf of His Excellency, Fulgencio\nBatista.\n\nTHE VIEW BEGINS TO MOVE along the various men gathered for\nthis meeting.\n\nLEON (O.S.)\nI'd like to thank this distinguished\ngroup of American Industrialists,\nfor continuing to work with Cuba,\nfor the greatest period of\nprosperity in her entire history.\nMr. William Proxmiro, representing\nthe General Fruit Company...

Then proudly, he\nlifts a shiny yellow telephone for all to see.\n\nLEON\nThe President would like to take\nthis opportunity to thank U T&T for\ntheir lovely gift: a solid gold\ntelephone!  He thought all you\ngentlemen would care to take a look\nat it.\n\nHe hands the heavy phone set to one of his aides, and it is\npassed in turn to each of the men in attendance.\n\nCORNGOLD\nYour Excellency, perhaps you could\ndiscuss the status of rebel activity\nand how this may affect our\nbusinesses.\n\nMED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL\n\nHe receives the telephone, and glances at it before passing\nit on to Hyman Roth.\n\nLEON (O.S.)\nOf course.  The rebel movement is\nbasically unpopular, and since July\nof 1958 has been contained in the\nOriente Province, in the mountains\nof the Sierra Muestre.\n\nMichael passes the phone on to Roth.\n\nLEON\n(continuing)\n\nWe began a highly successful\n\n\n\noffensive against them in March,\nand activities within the city\nitself are at a minimum.  I can\nassure you we'll tolerate no\nguerrillas in the casinos or\nswimming pools!\n\nGeneral subdued laughter.\n\nA CUBAN STREET - LATE DAY\n\nPolice are stopping traffic.  Michael's Mercury is among the\ncars; a police officer, seeing that some important person is\nbeing driven, walks up to the driver.  He leans forward, and\nsays something in Spanish to the driver.\n\nThe driver, in turn, leans over to Michael.\n\nDRIVER\nHe says it will just be a short\ntime and they'll let us through.\n\nMichael looks out the window.\n\nMICHAEL'S VIEW\n\nThe old building has been totally surrounded by police and\nmilitary vehicles.  Right at this moment, they are waiting\nlazily, but soldiers are there with automatic weapons ready.\nThere is a momentary commotion inside the building, and the\nmen brace up.  A Captain of the Army detachment says\nsomething in Spanish over a megaphone; and his men put their\nweapons at the ready, as other policemen lead a group of\ncivilians out of the building with their hands up.\n\nThey are moved over to some military truck, where they are\nfrisked before being loaded.\n\nAll of a sudden, one of the civilian rebels breaks loose,\nand rushes toward the command vehicle.  He hurls himself\ninto the vehicle, as two police try to pull him out.  A\nsecond later, and there is an explosion; the man obviously\nhaving hidden a grenade on his body, sacrificing his own\nlife to take the life of the Captain.\n\nThere is a commotion, but the military quickly quell it.\n\nCLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL\n\nwatching.  The police rush to Michael's car and guide it\noutside of the trouble area.\n\nMED. VIEW\n\nas they lead and escort the Mercury out of the area.\n\nEXT.

Now two\nCubans in white carry a table which has a lovely small cake\non it.\n\nSAM ROTH\nThe cake is here.\n\nThey all raise their glasses to the old man.\n\nEVERYONE\n(ad lib)\n\nHappy Birthday!\n\nRoth glances at the cake and its inscription, is pleased.\n\nROTH\nI hope my age is correct: I am\nalways accurate about my age.\n\nSome laugh.  He nods, and they begin to cut it, put a piece\non plates, and carry them to the different men.\n\nROTH\nEverything we've learned in Vegas\nis true here; but we can go further.\nThe bigger, the swankier, the\nplusher the store, the more a sense\nof legitimacy, and the bigger\nbusiness we do.\n\n(looking at the plate\nbrought to him)\n\nA smaller piece.  What we've\nproposed to the Cuban Government is\nthat it put up half the cash on a\ndollar for dollar basis.\n\n(accepting a smaller piece)\nThank you.  We can find people in\nthe United States who will put up\nour share for a small piece of the\naction, yet we will retain control.\n\nONE OF THE MEN\nHow much?\n\nROTH\nA hundred million dollars.  But\nonly if this Government relaxes its\nrestrictions on importing building\nmaterials; we'll need some new\nlaws, too, but that will be no\ndifficulty.\n\nANOTHER MAN\nWhat are import duties now?\n\nROTH\nAs much as seventy percent.  Also,\n\n\n\nI'm working out an arrangement with\nthe Minister of Labor so that all\nour pit bosses, stick-men and\nDealers, can be considered\nspecialized technicians eligible\nfor two year visas.  As of now\nthey're only allowed in Cuba for\nsix months at a time.  In short,\nwe're in a full partnership with\nthe Cuban Government.\n\nVIEW ON MICHAEL\n\nis handed a piece of cake.  Roth moves over to a folder of\ndocuments.\n\nROTH\n(continuing)\n\nHere are applications from Friends\nall over the States.  I understand\nSanto Virgilio in Tampa is trying\nto make his own deal.  Well, the\nCuban Government will brush him off.\nThe Lakeville Road Boys are going\nto take over the Nacionale here.\nI'm planning a new hotel casino to\nbe known as Riviera.

Rather than be taken\nalive, he exploded a grenade hidden\nin his jacket, taking the command\nvehicle with him.\n\nThe various men look up as Michael eats his cake, wondering\nwhat the point of it is.\n\nMICHAEL\nIt occurred to me: the police are\npaid to fight, and the Rebels are\nnot.\n\n\n\nSAM ROTH\nSo?\n\nMICHAEL\nSo, that occurred to me.\n\nVIEW ON ROTH\n\nHe understands Michael's point, if the others do not.\n\nROTH\nThis country has had rebels for the\nlast fifty years; it's part of\ntheir blood.  Believe me, I know...\nI've been coming here since the\ntwenties; we were running molasses\nout of Havana when you were a baby.\nTo trucks owned by your father.\n\n(he chuckles warmly\nover the memory)\n\nWe'll talk when we're alone.\n\nAnd he returns his attention to the men who are gathered\nwith him on his birthday.\n\nEXT. ROTH'S PRIVATE TERRACE - DAY\n\nMichael sits alone with the old man, on a terrace that\noverlooks the city.\n\nROTH\nYou have to be careful what you say\nin front of the others... they\nfrighten easy.  It's always been\nthat way, most men frighten easy.\n\nMICHAEL\nWe're making a big investment in\nCuba.  That's my only concern.\n\nROTH\nMy concern is that the three\nmillion never arrived at Batista's\nnumbered account in Switzerland.\nHe thinks it's because you have\nsecond thoughts about his ability\nto stop the rebels.\n\nMICHAEL\nThe money was sent.\n\nROTH\nThen you have to trace it.  Michael,\npeople here look at me as a reliable\nman.  I can't afford not to be\nlooked on as a reliable man.  But\nyou know all that; there's nothing\nyou can learn from me.  You\nshouldn't have to put up with a\nsick old man as a partner.\n\nMICHAEL\nI wouldn't consider anyone else.\n\nROTH\nExcept the President of the United\nStates.\n\n\n\nHe laughs slyly, as though this is some private joke between\nthem.  Then his laughter becomes a cough, which he painfully\nstifles with a handkerchief.\n\nROTH\nIf only I could live to see it,\nkid; to be there with you.  How\nbeautifully we've done it, step by\nstep.  Here, protected, free to\nmake our profits without the\nJustice Department, the FBI; ninety\nmiles away in partnership with a\nfriendly government.  Ninety miles,\njust a small step, looking for a\nman who desperately wants to be\nPresident of the United States, and\nhaving the cash to make it possible.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou'll be there to see it; you'll\nbe there.\n\nINT.

He said he had\nkilled his Grandfather...\n\nVIEW ON HAGEN\n\nlistening, calmly.\n\nKAY\n... He said he had shot his\nGrandfather with a gun, and then he\ndied in the garden.

Kay...\n\nVIEW ON KAY\n\nKAY\nWhat kind of a family is this...\nare we human beings?  He knows his\nFather killed his Uncle Carlo.  He\nheard Connie.\n\nHAGEN\nYou don't know that's true.  But\nKay, just for the sake of an\nargument, let's assume it is, I'm\nnot saying it is, remember, but...\nWhat if I gave you what might be\nsome justification for what he\ndid... or rather some possible\njustification for what he possibly\ndid.\n\nKAY\nThat's the first time I've seen the\nlawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not\nyour best side.\n\nHAGEN\nOkay, just hear me out.  What if\nCarlo had been paid to help get\nSonny killed?  What if his beating\nof Connie that time was a deliberate\nplot to get Sonny out into the open?\nThen what?  And what if the Don, a\ngreat man, couldn't bring himself\nto do what he had to do, avenge his\nson's death by killing his\ndaughter's husband?  What if that,\nfinally, was too much for him, and\nhe made Michael his successor,\nknowing that Michael would take\nthat load off his shoulders, would\ntake that guilt?\n\n\n\nKAY\nHe's not the same as when I met him.\n\nHAGEN\nIf he were, he'd be dead by now.\nYou'd be a widow.  You'd have no\nproblem.\n\nKAY\nWhat the hell does that mean?  Come\non, Tom, speak out straight once in\nyour life.  I know Michael can't,\nbut you're not Sicilian, you can\ntell a woman the truth; you can\ntreat her like an equal, a fellow\nhuman being.\n\nThere is a long silence.\n\nThen Hagen shakes his head; he can tell her no more.\n\nHAGEN\nIf you told Michael what I've told\nyou today, I'm a dead man.\n\nKAY\nWhen is it finally over?  I want it\nto be over before my baby is born.\n\nHAGEN\nI don't know.  I hope soon; but\nit's not over yet, and that's why\nyou and the kids have to come back\nto me.\n\nHe looks at her; it's clear that he has been entrusted with\nher safety and her children's.\n\nHe is a kind, good man, and seems very nervous and\noverwrought.\n\nVIEW ON THE WINDOW\n\nLittle Anthony is pressing his face against the glass pane,\nas though he senses the adults are discussing something of\nimportance to him.\n\nINT.

We did our first\nwork together, worked our way out\nof the street.  Things were good\nand we made the most of it.  During\nprohibition, we ran molasses up to\nCanada and made a fortune; your\nfather too.  I guess as much as\nanyone, I loved him and trusted him.\nLater on he had an idea to make a\ncity out of a desert stop-over for\nG.I.'s on the way to the West Coast.\nThat kid's name was Moe Greene, and\nthe city he invented was Las Vegas.\nThis was a great man; a man with\nvision and guts; and there isn't\neven a plaque or a signpost or a\nstatue of him in that town.  Someone\nput a bullet through his eye; no\none knows who gave the order.  When\nI heard about it I wasn't angry.  I\nknew Moe; I knew he was headstrong,\nand talking loud, and saying stupid\nthings.  So when he turned up dead,\nI let it go, and said to myself:\nthis is the business we've chosen.\nI never asked, who gave the go\nahead because it had nothing to do\nwith business.\n\nHe regards Michael silently a moment.\n\nROTH\n(continuing)\n\nThere's three million dollars on\nthat table.  I'm going to lie down,\nmaybe take a nap.  When I wake up,\nif it's still there, I'll know I\nhave a partner.

The President himself, his back to our\nVIEW, is making an announcement in Spanish.  While he\nspeaks, we notice continuous movement of his personal staff,\ncarrying suitcases and possessions.\n\nPRESIDENT\n\n\n\n...Because of serious setbacks of\nour troops in Guantanamo and\nSantiago, we feel reluctantly, that\nwe must leave the Capital at once.\nMyself and my family must bid you\ngoodbye, and good fortune.  We will\ngo directly to Ciudad Trujillo.\n\nThe crowd is stunned; already whispers are moving throughout\nthe guests.\n\nThe only one who is not completely taken off guard is\nMichael, who quietly steps back, and disappears from the room.\n\nPRESIDENT\n...My only regret is that there\ncould not have been more warning...\nAs my last official act as\nPresident, I hereby appoint a\nprovisional government with Dr.\nCarlos M. Piedra, as its President.\n\nBy now, there is only one thought among the guests: how can\nthey get out, and with what.\n\nEXT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT\n\nWe see evidence of the confusion at this late hour; already\ncars are beginning to move; people leaving the Palace in\nhaste.  Michael moves quickly toward his car.  He sees\nFredo, watching him in fear.\n\nMICHAEL\nCome with me.  It's your only way\nof getting out!\n\nVIEW ON FREDO\n\nTerrified of his brother, and what he knows; Fredo backs\naway into the growing noise and confusion of the crowd.\n\nVIEW ON MICHAEL\n\nFinally, he has to step into the car and it roars off.\n\nEXT. HAVANA STREETS - NIGHT\n\nRebel cars with loudspeakers have already picked up the news\nthat Batista has conceded...this throws the crowds already\ngathered for the New Year into cheers of joy.\n\nThey harass a wealthy family who are trying to get away in\ntheir car.\n\nThe people pull them out of the car, opening their suitcases,\nout of which spill piles of cash and jewelry into street.\n\nMichael's car makes its way as the crowd cheers: \"El animale\nse fue!\"\n\nEXT. THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY - MED. VIEW - NIGHT\n\nCrowds of panicked and frightened tourists, and Batistianos\nare trying to get to the safety of the Embassy with the\nfamilies and possessions.\n\nWe see Geary, and some of the Americans we had met, working\ntheir way through the crowds, shouting that they are\nAmericans in order to get preference on the line.  Often\n\n\n\nthat declaration brings 'boos' from the crowds.\n\nSometimes the joyous Cubans will let a family through, but\nagain, taking away the suitcases, rich leather, filled with\nmoney and valuables.  Money seems to be stuffed everywhere.\n\nEXT. THE YACHT CLUB - NIGHT\n\nAll forms of private transportation are jammed with people\ntrying to get out, holding cash in their hands for anyone\nwith a yacht or small boat to get them to Florida.\n\nA car pulls up; and we see Sam Roth, Terri Roth and some of\ntheir men, carry the sickly, but still alive Hyman Roth to a\nprivate cruiser which is protected by men with machine guns.\n\nWithin seconds, they are on their way to Miami.\n\nEXT. THE PRIVATE AIRPORT - NIGHT\n\nThings are no different at the airport; where anything that\ncan fly is being jammed with refugees and their money.\n\nA wealthy family is arguing with the pilot of a fast\nairplane; trying to force cash on him, and his family into\nthe plane.  The PILOT steadfastly refuses, although checking\nhis watch, as though his passengers are late.  He speaks\nonly English.\n\nPILOT\nNo, this is a private plane.  No,\nthis plane is taken.\n\nFinally Michael's Mercury pulls up, and Michael approaches\nthe Pilot.\n\nMICHAEL\nHe isn't here.\n\nPILOT\nWe've got to leave, they'll take\nthis thing apart.\n\nMICHAEL\nAll right.  Go now.\n\nThe Pilot lets Michael in, as the Cuban screams curses at\nthem, and begins searching for another plane for his family.\n\nINT.

It is my pleasure to make\nthis a gift.\n\nCLOSE VIEW ON VITO\n\nVITO\nYou are kind.  If ever I can do\nsomething for you, in return,\nplease come to me.\n\nINT. VITO'S TENEMENT - DAY\n\nDespite his new position of 'respect,' there is little\nchanged about his home.  Only that they have lived there a\nwhile now, and the rooms are fuller with the inevitable\npossessions a young family acquires.\n\nHe kisses his wife, who seems a big apprehensive.  He shows\nher the fruit; and from her reaction knows she has something\non her mind.\n\nVITO\n(Sicilian)\n\nWhat is it?\n\nCARMELLA\n(Sicilian)\n\nCome...\n\nThey step into the tiny parlor, where we see an older woman,\nwaiting nervously.\n\nCARMELLA\nThe Signora is a friend of mine.\nShe has a favor to ask of you.\n\nVITO\n(Sicilian)\n\nWhy do you come to me?\n\nSIGNORA COLOMBO\n(Sicilian)\n\nShe told me to ask you.\n\nHe seems surprised; looks to his wife.\n\nCARMELLA\nShe is having some trouble.  Her\nlandlord has received complaints\nbecause of her dog.  He told her to\nget rid of it, but her boy loved\nit, so they tried to hide it.  When\nthe landlord found out, he was so\nangry, he ordered her to leave.\nEven if she truly will let the dog\ngo.\n\nSIGNORA COLOMBO\n(Sicilian)\n\nHe said he would have the police\nput us out.\n\nVITO\n(thoughtfully)\n\nI can give you some money to help\nyou move, is that what you want?\n\nSIGNORA COLOMBO\nMy friends are all here; how can I\n\n\n\nmove to another neighborhood with\nstrangers?  I want you to speak to\nthe landlord to let me stay.\n\nVito nods to the frightened old woman.\n\nVITO\nIt's done then.  You won't have to\nmove; I'll speak to him tomorrow\nmorning.\n\nCarmella breaks into a smile; which her husband des not\nacknowledge.\n\nThe old woman starts to leave the room; but she is not\nconvinced.\n\nSIGNORA COLOMBO\nYou're sure he'll say yes, the\nlandlord?\n\nVITO\nI'm sure he's a good-hearted fellow.\nOnce I explain how things are with\nyou, I'm sure he'll take pity on\nyour misfortunes.  Don't let it\ntrouble you any more.\n\n(as he shows her out)\nGuard your health, for the sake of\nyour children.\n\nEXT. TENEMENT BLOCK - DAY\n\nSIGNOR ROBERTO, a pompous, rather well-dressed Patrone\nangrily walks down the steps of one of his tenement buildings.\n\nHe carries a check list, and makes marks with a pencil\nconcerning the condition of his various buildings; a broken\nwindow here, some missing tile there.  He bends over to pick\nup some garbage left by a thoughtless tenant, muttering to\nhimself, when he sees the shoes and legs of a young worker.\n\nVITO (O.S.)\nSignore Roberto...\n\nHe rises to be face to face with a polite Vito Corleone.\n\nVITO\nThe friend of my wife, a poor widow\nwith no man to protect her, tells\nme that for some reason she has\nbeen ordered to move from your\nbuilding.  She is in despair.  She\nhas no money, she has no friends\nexcept those that live here.\n\nSignor Roberto brusquely answers, and continues on his way.\n\nROBERTO\nI have already rented the apartment\nto another family.\n\nMOVING SHOT ON THE TWO\n\nVITO\nI told her I would speak to you,\nthat you are a reasonable man who\nacted out of some misunderstanding.\nShe has gotten rid of the animal\n\n\n\nthat caused all the trouble, so why\nshouldn't she stay.  As one Italian\nto another, I ask you the favor.\n\nROBERTO\nI've already rented it; I cannot\ndisappoint the new tenants.  They're\npaying a higher rent.\n\nVITO\nHow much more a month?\n\nROBERTO\nEh...\n\n(we sense he is lying)\nFive dollars more.\n\nVito reaches into his pocket, and takes out a roll of bills.\n\nVITO\nHere is the six month's increase in\nadvance.  You needn't speak to her\nabout it, she's a proud woman.  See\nme again in another six months.\nBut of course, you'll let her keep\nher dog.\n\nROBERTO\nLike hell!  And who the hell are\nyou to give me orders.  Watch your\nmanners or you'll be on your\nSicilian ass in the street there.\n\nVito raises his hands in surprise; his voice is reasonable.\n\nVITO\nI'm asking you a favor, only that.\nOne never knows when one might need\na friend, isn't that true?  Here,\ntake this money as a sign of my\ngood-will, and make your own\ndecision.  I won't quarrel with it.\n\n(he puts the money in\nRoberto's hand)\n\nDo me this little favor, just take\nit and think carefully.  Tomorrow\nmorning if you want to give me the\nmoney back, by all means do so.  If\nyou want the woman out of your\nhouse, how can I stop you?  It's\nyour property, after all.  If you\ndon't want the dog in there, I can\nunderstand.  I dislike dogs myself.\n\n(he pats Roberto on\nthe shoulder)\n\nDo me this service, eh?  I won't\nforget it.  Ask your friends in\nthis neighborhood about me, they'll\ntell you I'm a man who believes in\nshowing his gratitude.\n\nWithout a word more, Vito leaves a hypnotized Roberto\nstanding in front of the tenement, his hand clasping the\nmoney.\n\nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY\n\nA thin young man, almost gawky, walks down the street in\nthis Italian neighborhood, his name is HYMAN SUCHOWSKY.\n\n\n\nHe carries his tools as he comes home from work.  He is\npursued and tormented by a couple of Italian youths, about\nhis own age, eighteen.\n\nITALIAN BOY\nKid, where do you live?\n\nANOTHER\nWhere'd you get those nigger lips?\n\nHe tries not to be intimidated; finally one of the boys,\nsteps in front of him and stops him.\n\nITALIAN BOY\nSay 'bread' in Italian.\n\nANOTHER\nHe dunno.\n\nITALIAN BOY\nGo on; how do you say 'bread' in\nItalian?  If you're from the\nneighborhood, you should know how\nto say 'bread' in Italian.\n\nAn amused Peter Clemenza steps forward from a local coffee\nhouse, to preside over the fuss.  He's a 'big' man in the\nneighborhood, and loves a fight.\n\nCLEMENZA\nWhat's up?\n\nITALIAN BOY\nThis kid lives around here, but he\ncan't say bread in Italian.\n\nCLEMENZA\nThat's 'cause he's Jew.  Look at\nthose pregnant lips!\n\nHe giggles at his own joke.\n\nITALIAN BOY\nAre you a Jewboy?\n\nThe boy doesn't answer, tries to keep going.\n\nITALIAN BOY\nWell, if you're not a Jew, say\n'bread' in Italian.  See, he can't.\n\nAnd with that, he rounds a blow squarely to the boy's face,\nsending him sprawling to the cement, his tools flying with a\nclatter.\n\nThe other Italian immediately joins in with a few kicks to\nthe boy's stomach.  Hyman tries to fight back; grabs a hold\nof his tormentor's foot, and brings him down on the cement\nas well.  For a moment, they are rolling around on the\nsidewalk, two against one, Hyman taking the worst of it.\n\nCLEMENZA\nAlright, alright, cut it out.\n\nSECOND ITALIAN\nWhat for?  He killed Jesus Christ!\n\nClemenza pulls him off, and kicks him in the ass.\n\n\n\nCLEMENZA\nI said cut it out!\n\n(to the beaten kid)\nWhat's your name?\n\nHYMAN\nHyman Suchowsky.\n\nITALIAN BOY\nI don't believe it.  In our\nneighborhood, with a name like that!\n\nCLEMENZA\nWhat are those tools?  You work on\ncars?\n\nHYMAN\nYeah.\n\nCLEMENZA\nMaybe I know how you can make a\ncouple of extra bucks working as a\nmechanic.\n\nThe boy seems agreeable.\n\nCLEMENZA\nBut you gotta know how to keep your\nmouth shut, and fer Chrissakes, get\nrid of that name.  I'll call you\nJohnny Lips.\n\n(he giggles at his\nown humor again)\n\nCome on...\n\nHe leads the boy down the street, whispering to him, on the\nside:\n\nCLEMENZA\nBread in Italian is pane.  P-A-N-E,\npane.  Don't forget.\n\nINT. NEW GENCO WAREHOUSE - DAY\n\nA newly acquired warehouse, stocked with cases of the new\nproduct \"GENCO PURA\" olive oil.  It is the beginning of a\nnew business, in the American tradition.  Now they have one\nrattling old truck, and a few stock boys.\n\nGenco has become the accountant-business manager, based on\nthe experience working with his father.  But it is clear,\nthat Vito is the leader, and undisputed 'President' of the\nnew enterprise.\n\nGenco moves through the darkness of the warehouse, to the\nsmall divided area that Vito uses as his office.\n\nGENCO\n(Sicilian)\n\nThe 'patrone' is here.\n\nVITO\nChi?\n\nGENCO\nRoberto.  Who owns the 'rat-holes.'\n\nVito nods that he will see him; and soon Roberto enters, on\n\n\n\ntiptoe, his hat in his hand, and in a apologetic voice.\n\nROBERTO\nExcuse me, I hope I am not a\ndisturbance, Don Corleone.\n\nVITO\nYes.\n\nROBERTO\nWhat a terrible misunderstanding.\nOf course, Signora Colombo can stay\nin the flat.  Who were those\nmiserable tenants to complain about\nnoise from a poor animal...when\nthey pay such low rent.\n\nThen abruptly, he puts the roll of money on Vito's table,\nand steps back a respectful distance.\n\nROBERTO\nYour good heart in helping the poor\nwidow has shamed me, and I want to\nshow that I, too, have some\nChristian charity.  Her rent will\nremain what it was.\n\nVITO\nWhat was that?\n\nROBERTO\nIn fact, reduced, bu five dollars!\n\nVito embraces him warmly.\n\nVITO\nI accept your generosity...\n\nROBERTO\nI won't keep you another minute...\n\nHe quickly takes his leave, bowing several times, and then\nmakes it back to the safety of the warehouse; he sighs,\ndeflates his lungs, and mops his brow; his bones have turned\ntoo jelly with fear at his narrow escape.  He all but runs\nout of the warehouse.\n\nGenco laughs as he watches.\n\nGENCO\nWe won't see him for weeks!  He'll\nstay in bed in the Bronx!\n\nClemenza has been waiting with his new mechanic.  We notice\nthe subtle difference in the way he treats Vito.  He is no\nlonger a junior apprentice in their petty crimes; but an\nimposing leader.\n\nCLEMENZA\nThis kid is good with cars; he\nkiijed at the truck, and says he\ncan keep it going.\n\nVito looks over the lanky young man.\n\nCLEMENZA\nWhat's your name?\n\nHYMAN\n\n\n\nSuchowsky.  Hyman Suchowsky.\n\nCLEMENZA\nHe's gonna dump that; I call him\nJohnny Lips.\n\nVITO\nWho is the greatest man you can\nthink of?\n\nCLEMENZA\nGo on, answer him when he talks to\nyou.  Tell him: Columbus, Marconi...\nGaribaldi.\n\nHYMAN\nArnold Rothstein.\n\nVITO\nThen take that as your name: Hyman\nRothstein.\n\nGenco is out in the alley; he calls out with glee.\n\nGENCO\nVitone!  Look at this!\n\nVito moves out to the smiling Genco; Clemenza and the newly\nchristened Hyman Rothstein follow a distance behind.\n\nEXT. THE ALLEY - DAY\n\nGenco stands beaming, as two workers raise up high, the\nfreshly painted sign: \"GENCO OLIVE OIL COMPANY.\"\n\nGENCO\n(enthusiastically)\n\nGod bless America!

Cicci\nreacts to this by being even more brutally forthright than\nhe has to be, to show his contempt for what he considers a\nhypocrisy.\n\nThe VIEW ALTERS from Senator Kane to the Committee's\nattorney, Mr. Questadt.\n\nQUESTADT\nYou mean you killed people at the\nbehest of your superiors?\n\nCICCI\nThat's right, counsellor.\n\nQUESTADT\nAnd the head of your family was\nMichael Corleone.\n\nCICCI\nYeah, counsellor, Michael Corleone.\n\nSENATOR KANE\nDid you ever get such an order\ndirectly from Michael Corleone?\n\nCICCI\nNo, Senator, I never talked to him.\n\nSENATOR SAVOY\n(very autocratic,\ndeep South,\ngentlemanly man)\n\nThere was always a buffer, someone\nin between you who gave you orders.\n\nCICCI\nYeah, a buffer, the Family had a\nlot of buffers.\n\nEXT.

THE BAY - DAY\n\nA team of Sicilian fisherman are at work mending their nets.\nOne sings accompanied by a guitar.\n\nVIEW MOVES TO ONE OF THE OLD FISHERMAN\n\nHe is recognized as the second of the men who had hunted\nVito down.  STROLLO.  As he walks we notice there is a\nfigure that is moving through the drying sails and barrels,\nit is Vito.  He moves quietly, stepping up behind the old\nman.  In an instant, he has thrown a garrote around his\nthroat, twisting it tight, so that there is very little\nsound.\n\nThen, almost silently dragging him through the space hidden\nby the drying sails.\n\nEXT. THE IMPRESSIVE ESTATE OF DON FRANCESCO - DAY\n\nWe see an old car approach.  Its driver is the young Tomasino.\nSitting in the car with him is Vito.\n\nThe car stops at the gates, and an old guard sees and\nrecognizes Tomasino, opens the gates allowing them to enter.\n\nMED. VIEW\n\non an almost decrepit DON FRANCESCO.  He must be in his\nearly nineties, sitting as powerful and as impressive as\never, in his throne-like chair from which he manages the\npower as the Mafia Chieftan of this village.  Young Don\nTomasino is speaking.\n\nWe notice in a little distance in the rear, there are some\nyounger shepherds with shotguns thrown over their shoulders.\n\nTOMASINO\n(Sicilian)\n\nDon Francesco, if you will honor\nme, by allowing me to introduce my\nassociate in America, in New York.\nHis name is Vito Corleone.\n\nThe old man and his eyes glance up at a notion of a man who\nhas taken the name of this town as his name.\n\nTOMASINO\nWe will supply him with olive oil\nexclusively in the town of Corleone.\nHis company is called the \"Genco\nOlive Oil Company.\" Here we have\nbrought you an indication of how he\nwill sell the product.\n\nTomasino respectfully puts a can of olive oil where the old\nman can look at it.  The old man nods, accepting the notion\nof this business.\n\nTOMASINO\n(Sicilian)\n\nWe have come to ask your blessing\nand permission to continue this\nenterprise.\n\n\n\nDON FRANCESCO\n(Sicilian)\n (in a shrill, high,\nraspy voice)\n\nWhere is this young man?\n\nTOMASINO\nHe is right here, standing next to\nme, Don Francesco.\n\nDON FRANCESCO\n(Sicilian)\n\nHave him come closer, I can't see\nvery well.\n\nVito takes those several steps, so that he is standing right\nin front of the old man.\n\nVIEW ON DON FRANCESCO\n\nlooking up, squinting against the sun.\n\nDON FRANCESCO'S VIEW\n\nStrangely backlit, almost blurry image of the young man from\nAmerica.\n\nDON FRANCESCO\n(Sicilian)\n\nWhat is your name?\n\nVITO\n(Sicilian)\n\nVito Corleone.\n\nDON FRANCESCO\n(Sicilian)\n\nYou took the name of this town, eh?\nWhat was your father's name?\n\nVITO\n(Sicilian)\n\nAntonio Andolini.\n\nCLOSE VIEW ON THE OLD MAN\n\nThe recognition of the name throws a shudder through him.\nIt is as though he recognizes that this is the boy; the son\nof his old enemy, whom he had killed, and whose sons he had\ntried to wipe out.  The old man raises his feeble hands\nsignalling his guard, and in his weak voice, he shouts:\n\nDON FRANCESCO\n(Sicilian)\n\nKill him!  Kill him!\n\nBut he is too late; Vito steps forward.\n\nVITO\n(Sicilian)\n\nIn the name of my Father, and my\nBrother...\n\nAnd uses the knife, ritualistically plunging it into the old\nman's belly, and then up to his throat, which is severed.\n\nVIEW ON TOMASINO\n\n\n\nhas drawn his pistol and quickly shoots one of the guards,\nhelping Vito to escape back into the motor car.\n\nVIEW ON A GUARD\n\nraising his shotgun.\n\nVIEW ON THE MOTOR CAR\n\nJust as Tomasino is about to get into the car, the shotgun\nis fired, and he is hit in the legs.\n\nVito manages to pull him up into the car, and they make\ntheir escape.\n\nEXT. RAILROAD STATION IN CORLEONE - DAY\n\nSome of the townspeople have come bringing flowers and gifts\nfor Vito and his family.\n\nHis wife is radiant with the flowers given her.\n\nThe train has arrived and the crowd shout \"Ciao, come back\nsoon.\"\n\nTHE VIEW ALTERS\n\nrevealing his good friend Tomasino, waving from his\nwheelchair.\n\nVIEW ON VITO\n\nand his wife.  She holds up the baby Michael, and helps him\nwave his hand.\n\nINT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - MED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL - DAY\n\nSENATOR KANE (O.S.)\nAre you the son of Vito Corleone?\n\nMICHAEL\nYes.\n\nSENATOR KING\nDid he use at times an alias?  Was\nthis alias in certain circles\nGODFATHER?\n\nMICHAEL\nIt was not an alias.  GODFATHER was\na term of affection, used by his\nfriends, one of respect.\n\nSENATOR WEEKLER\n(Senator from New\nYork, very smooth,\npartly liberal,\nTammany Hall)\n\nLet me agree with that.  Many of my\nconstituents are Italian and have\nbeen honored with that certain\nfriendship by my close Italian\nfriends.  Up to this point before I\nhave to leave this hearing to join\nmy own committee, let me say, that\nthis hearing on the Mafia is in no\nway a slur on the Italians by the\nSenate; nor is it meant to be; nor\nwill I allow it to be.  Italian\n\n\n\nAmericans are the hardest working,\nmost law abiding patriotic Americans\nof our country.  It is a shame and\na pity that a few rotten apples\ngive them a bad name.  We are here\nto weed those rotten apples out of\nthe vast healthy barrel of Italian\nAmericans, who are one of the\nbackbones of our country.\n\nThere is a pause for a while, while the New York Senator\nposes for the TV cameras and leaves the hearing so that he\nwill not be associated with hearing the rough stuff.\n\nSENATOR KANE\nI'm sure we all agree with our\nesteemed colleague.  Now, Mr.\nCorleone, you have been advised as\nto your legal rights.  We have had\ntestimony from a preceding witness\nwho states you are head of the most\npowerful Mafia family in this\ncountry.  Are you?\n\nMICHAEL\nNo.\n\nSENATOR KANE\nThis witness has testified that you\nare personally responsible for the\nmurder of a New York Police Captain\nin the year 1947 and with him a man\nnamed Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny\nthis?\n\nMICHAEL\nI deny his every charge.\n\nSENATOR KANE\nIs it true that in the year 1950\nyou devised the murder of the heads\nof the Five Families in New York,\nto assume and consolidate your\nnefarious power?\n\nMICHAEL\nThat is a complete falsehood.\n\nSENATOR KANE\nIs it true that you own a\ncontrolling interest in three of\nthe major hotels in Las Vegas?\n\nMICHAEL\nThat is not true.  I own some stock\nin some of the hotels, but only\nvery small amounts.  I also own\nsome American Telephone and IBM\nstock.\n\nMichael had checked this point with Hagen, before answering,\nand then once again after the answer.\n\nSENATOR ROGERS\nWhy is it necessary for your\ncounsel to advise you on that\nquestion?\n\nMICHAEL\n\n\n\nSenator, I've observed the head of\nGeneral Motors before a Senate\nCommittee, and his lawyer whispered\nin his ear.  That was not commented\nupon in the way you have just done.\n\nSENATOR KANE\nMr. Corleone, do you have any hotel\ninterests in the state of Arizona?\nOr any gambling interests in that\nstate?\n\nMICHAEL\nI do not.\n\nSENATOR KANE\nDo you have interests or control\nover gambling and narcotics in the\nstate of New York.\n\nMICHAEL\nI do not.\n\nA pause.  Silence, as the Chairman whispers something to his\nassistant.\n\nTom Hagen takes a paper out of his briefcase, and addresses\nthe Chair.\n\nHAGEN\nSenator, my client would like to\nread a statement for the record.\n\nSENATOR KANE\nI don't think that's necessary.\n\nHAGEN\nSir, my client has answered every\nquestion asked by this committee\nwith the utmost cooperation and\nsincerity.  He has not taken that\nFifth Amendment as it was his right\nto do, and which because of the\nextreme legal complexity of this\nhearing, counsel advised him to do.\nSo, I think in all fairness this\ncommittee should hear his statement\nand put it in the record.\n\nSENATOR KANE\nVery well.\n\nAt this point Senator Rogers contemptuously walks out of the\nhearing room.\n\nMICHAEL\n(reading)\n\nIn the hopes of clearing my family\nname, in the sincere desire to give\nmy children their fair share of the\nAmerican way of life without a\nblemish on their name and background\nI have appeared before this\ncommittee and given it all the\ncooperation in my power.  I consider\nmy being called before this\ncommittee an act of prejudice to\nall Americans of Italian extraction.\nI consider it a great dishonor to\n\n\n\nme personally to have to deny that\nI am a criminal.  I wish to have\nthe following noted for the record.\nThat I served my country faithfully\nand honorably in World War II and\nwas awarded the Distinguished\nService Cross for actions in\ndefense of my country.  That I have\nnever been arrested or indicted for\nany crime whatsoever... that no\nproof linking me to any criminal\nconspiracy, whether it is called\nMafia or Cosa Nostra or whatever\nother name you wish to give, has\never been made public.  Only one\nman has made charges against me,\nand that man is known to be a\nmurderer, arsonist and rapist.  And\nyet this committee had used this\nperson to besmirch my name.  My\npersonal protest can only be made\nto the people of this country.  I\ncan only thank God that in this\ncountry we have a legal system and\ncourts of law to protect innocent\npeople from wild accusation.  I\nthank God for our democratic due\nprocess of Law that shields me from\nthe false charges made by this\ncommittee's witness.  I have not\ntaken refuge behind the Fifth\nAmendment, though counsel advised\nme to do so.  I challenge this\ncommittee to produce any witness or\nevidence against me, and if they do\nnot, I hope they will have the\ndecency to clear my name with the\nsame publicity with which they have\nnow besmirched it.  I ask this\nwithout malice, in the interests of\nfair play.\n\nThe television cameras have documented this moment, as Hagen\nhands the document over to the committee lawyer.\n\nSENATOR ROGERS\nWe are all impressed.  The committee\nwill now recess over the weekend.\nHowever, it will continue Monday\nmorning, at eleven a.m.  At that\ntime, this committee will then\nproduce a witness directly linking\nMr. Corleone to the charges we have\nmade.  And then, Mr. Corleone may\nvery well by liable for indictments\nof perjury.  However, this document\nwill be made a matter of record.\n\nEXT. ARMY POST - DAY\n\nAn army post somewhere in the East.  It is safely guarded.\n\nINT. HOUSE ON THE POST - DAY\n\nwhere Pentangeli is being held by his constant companions,\nthe two FBI MEN.\n\nPENTANGELI\nTen to one shot, you said.  Ten to\n\n\n\none shot in my favor, and I lose.\n\nFBI MAN #1\nGet a good night's sleep.  We got a\nnew suit, new shirt, new tie, and\nI'm going to shave you myself.\nTomorrow we want you to look\nrespectable for fifty million of\nyour fellow Americans.\n\nPENTANGELI\nMy life won't be worth a nickel\nafter tomorrow.\n\nFBI MAN #1\nWe have a special home for you for\nthe rest of your life.  Nobody gets\nnear you.  You're not going any\nplace.\n\nPENTANGELI\nYeah, some deal I made.\n\nFBI MAN #2\nYou live like a king.  You'll be a\nhero.  You'll live better in here\nthan most people on the outside.\n\nPENTANGELI\nSome deal.\n\n(pause)\nI just wish Mike had took the Fifth.\n\nFBI MAN #1\nWhy'd you do it, Frankie?  After\nall these years, why'd you turn\nagainst him?\n\nPENTANGELI\nI didn't turn against nobody; he\nturned against me.\n\nEXT. THE BOATHOUSE ALCOVE - DAY\n\nA somewhat frightened Fredo Corleone sits in the easy chair\noverlooking the lake in this canopied section of the\nboathouse.  Rocco sits with him.\n\nINT. BOATHOUSE - DAY\n\nMichael is in the dark room with Hagen and Neri.\n\nMICHAEL\nHow did they get their hands on\nPentangeli?\n\nHAGEN\nRoth engineered it, Michael.  He\nmade Pentangeli think you hit him.\nDeliberately letting him get off\nalive.  Then the New York detectives\nturned Frankie over to the FBI.  My\ninformants say he was half dead and\nscared stiff -- talking out loud\nthat you had turned on him and\ntried to kill him.  Anyway, they\nhad him on possession, dealing in\nheroin, murder one and a lot more.\nThere's no way we can get to him\n\n\n\nand you've opened yourself to five\npoints of perjury.\n\nNERI\nThey've got him airtight.  He's in\na military base, twenty-four hour\nguards.  Trying to kill him is like\ntrying to like the President --\nit's impossible.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhat does Fredo know?\n\nHAGEN\nHe says he doesn't know anything,\nand I believe him.  Roth played\nthis one beautifully.\n\nMICHAEL\nAlright.  I'm going to go outside\nand talk to Fredo.\n\nEXT. BOATHOUSE FOYER - DAY\n\nFredo sits on the couch.  When Rocco sees Michael, he\nautomatically takes his leave.  Michael sits in the chair\nopposite Fredo.\n\nFREDO\n(after a pause)\n\nI don't have a lot to say, Michael.\n\nMICHAEL\nWe have time.\n\nFREDO\nI was kept pretty much in the dark.\nI didn't know all that much.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhat about now, is there anything\nyou can help me out with?\n\nFREDO\nI know they get Pentangeli, that's\nall I know.\n\nFredo gets up, walks to the glass panel that separates the\nterrace from the lake.\n\nFREDO\nI didn't know it was a hit.  I\nswear to you I didn't know.  Johnny\nOla contacted me in Beverly Hills --\nsaid he wanted to talk.  He said\nyou and Roth were in on some big\ndeal, and there was a place for me\nin it if I could help them out.\nThey said you were being tough on\nthe negotiation, and if they had a\nlittle bit of help, they could\nclose it fast and it would be good\nfor you.\n\nMICHAEL\nAnd you believed that story.\n\nFREDO\nHe said there was something good in\n\n\n\nit for me...me on my own.\n\nMICHAEL\nI've always taken care of you.\n\nFREDO\nTaken care of me.  Mike, you're my\nkid brother, and you take care of\nmy.  Did you ever think of that.\nEver once?  Send Fredo off to do\nthis, send Fredo to take care of\nthat... take care of some little\nunimportant night club here, and\nthere; pick somebody up at the\nairport.  Mike, I'm your older\nbrother; I was stepped over!\n\nMICHAEL\nIt's the way Pop wanted it.\n\nFREDO\nIt wasn't the way I wanted it!  I\ncan handle things.  I'm not dumb\nChrist, not like everyone says.\nI'm smart; and I want respect.\n\nMICHAEL\nThere's nothing more you can tell\nme about this investigation?\n\nFREDO\nThe lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to\nRoth.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou're nothing to me now, Fredo;\nnot a brother, not a friend, I\ndon't want to know you, or what\nhappens to you.  I don't want to\nsee you at the hotels, or near my\nhome.  When you visit our Mother, I\nwant to know a day in advance, so I\nwon't be there.  Do you understand?\n\nMichael turns, and starts to leave.  A frightened voice\nbehind him:\n\nFREDO\nMikey?\n\nMichael doesn't stop, doesn't turn back.  He continues off\nthrough the veranda, and out the summer doors.\n\nNeri stops by him.\n\nMICHAEL\nI don't want anything to happen to\nhim while my Mother's alive.\n\nMichael leaves.\n\nEXT. ARMY POST - DAY\n\nFive cars brimming with Army guards and Agents are waiting\nto move Pentangeli.  There is one empty car.\n\nINT. GUARDED HOUSE - DAY\n\nThe two FBI Agents are helping Pentangeli get dressed.  He's\n\n\n\nin brightly colored striped shorts and bare-chested.  The\nAgents help him with the shirt and tie.  One holds out the\ntrousers but Pentangeli ignores it and looks at himself in\nthe mirror.\n\nFBI MAN #1\nReady, Frankie.\n\nPENTANGELI\nLet's go.\n\nThe Agents open the door, and precede him, surveying the\narea.  They check the cars waiting, each with two Agents.\nThey check the gate and note the military sentries.  Then\nthey stand aside, and let Pentangeli come out.  They get\nclose to his side, and it is obvious they will protect his\nlife with their own.\n\nEXT. ARMY POST - DAY\n\nThe Agents put him in the front seat of the empty car, and\nget in with him, one at each side.  Another Agent drives.\nNow, the first cars start out; the Sentries opening the\ngates, and letting the caravan pass.\n\nAn Army supply truck comes very close to them, and the\nAgents next to Pentangeli become very tense.  Pentangeli\ngrins.  Then the truck passes on, and they relax.\n\nINT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - DAY\n\nThe room is crowded with TV journalists, cameras, etc.  We\npick Pentangeli up, closely guarded, being led to witness\nchair.\n\nPentangeli is seated, and made to take his oath.  FBI Agents\nare all around him.\n\nMED. VIEW\n\nAnyone given entrance to the caucus room is being frisked.\nThe five Senators take their places.\n\nVIEW ON HAGEN\n\nwaiting at his long table, very nervous.  He seems startled\nby the appearance of Pentangeli.\n\nVIEW ON PENTANGELI\n\ncatching Hagen's eye.  It's as though he is pleading for\nsome kind of understanding of the fact that he has become a\ntraitor.\n\nVIEW ON HAGEN\n\ncold; then he turns away.\n\nVIEW ON THE ENTRANCE\n\nThe bustle is settling down; then Michael Corleone enters,\nand with him is someone very peculiar and out of keeping for\nthis setting.  A burly-chested imposing man of middle age.\nVery powerful-looking with frightening magnetic eyes.  His\ndress is odd: boots, rough tie, and shirt.  He could be the\ntenor out of a Sicilian opera.  He is clearly a country Don,\ndirect from Sicily, and he dominates the room.\n\nVIEW ON PENTANGELI\n\n\n\nAt first his view is blocked.  Then he sees Michael and is a\nbit shamefaced, but still defiant.\n\nPENTANGELI'S POV\n\nMichael returns his glances without emotion.  Then the VIEW\nALTERS, revealing the Sicilian.\n\nVIEW ON PENTANGELI\n\nHe is terror stricken; obviously he recognizes the man.\n\nVIEW ON HAGEN'S TABLE\n\nMichael and the Sicilian sit by Hagen, where they can stare\ndirectly at Pentangeli; he is frozen with fear.\n\nVIEW ON THE SENATOR\n\nNotices the tension in the room.  The Chairman commences:\n\nSENATOR KANE\nWe have here a witness who will\ntestify further on Michael\nCorleone's rule of the criminal\nempire that controls gambling in\nthis country and perhaps in other\ncountries.  This witness had no\nbuffer between himself and Michael\nCorleone.  He can corroborate our\ncharges on enough counts for this\ncommittee to consider a charge of\nperjury against Michael Corleone.\n\n(then he turns to Pentangeli)\nYour name please, for the record.\n\nPENTANGELI\nFrank Pentangeli.\n\nSENATOR KANE\nWere you a member of the Corleone\nFamily?  Were you under the\nCaporegime Peter Clemenza, under\nVito Corleone, known as the\nGodfather?\n\nThere is a long silence.\n\nVIEW ON PENTANGELI\n\nHe seems unable to speak.\n\nVIEW ON THE SICILIAN\n\ngazing at him.\n\nVIEW ON PENTANGELI\n\nPENTANGELI\nI never knew no Godfather.  I got\nmy own family.\n\nSenator Kane is stunned.  The two FBI men are alert, their\neyes searching the room for what has intimidated their\nwitness at the last moment.\n\nSENATOR KANE\nMr. Pentangeli, you are\n\n\n\ncontradicting your confessions to\nour investigators; I ask you again,\nwere you a member of a crime\norganization headed by Michael\nCorleone?\n\nPENTANGELI\nNo.  I never heard of it.  I never\nheard of nothing like that.  I was\nin the olive oil business with his\nfather a long time ago.  That's all.\n\nSENATOR KANE\nWe have your confession that you\nmurdered on the orders of Michael\nCorleone.  Do you deny that\nconfession and do you know what\ndenying that confession will mean\nto you?\n\nThe die is cast and like a good soldier, Pentangeli will go\nall the way now.  So he is brazen in his defiance of the\nSenator.\n\nPENTANGELI\nThe FBI guys promised me a deal.\nSo I made up a lot of stuff about\nMichael Corleone.  Because then,\nthat's what they wanted.  But it\nwas all lies.  Everything.  They\nsaid Michael Corleone did this,\nMichael Corleone did that.  So I\nsaid, \"Yeah, sure.\"\n\nHe makes a big grin to show how he has made fools of\neverybody.\n\nVIEW ON THE FBI AGENTS\n\nglancing around the room; their eyes have settled on the\nSicilian.  One of them scribbles a note on a piece of paper,\nand passes it to the Committee lawyer.  Then in turn it goes\nto Senator Kane.\n\nSENATOR KANE\nMr. Hagen, would you kindly identify\nto this committee that gentleman\nsitting on your right hand?\n\nHAGEN\n(coolly)\n\nYes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo\nPentangeli.\n\nSENATOR KANE\nIs he related to the witness?\n\nHAGEN\nHe is, I believe, a brother.\n\nVIEW ON MICHAEL AND VINCENZO PENTANGELI\n\nThey wait with no expression.\n\nSENATOR KANE\n(to Vincenzo Pentangeli)\n\nSir, I would like you to take the\nstand.\n\n\n\nVincenzo stares at him, uncomprehending.  There may just be\na shadow of contempt.  He doesn't answer.\n\nHAGEN\nSir, the gentleman does not\nunderstand English.  He would not\nin any case, take the stand.  He\ncame, at his own expense, to aid\nhis brother in his trouble.  He is\nnot under any jurisdiction of our\ngovernment and his reputation in\nhis own country is impeccable.\n\nSENATOR KANE\n(furious)\n\nThe witness is excused; take him out.\n\nThe guards and FBI Agents quickly remove Pentangeli, as\neverybody else in the room is required to sit still.\n\nHAGEN\nSenator Kane.\n\nSENATOR KANE\nThis meeting is adjourned.\n\nHAGEN\n(rising and shouting)\n\nThis committee owes an apology!\n\nSENATOR KANE\nThe committee is adjourned until\nfurther notice.\n\nFor the first time, in the midst of the confusion, Hagen\nsmiles.  A bitter, contemptuous smile.\n\nVIEW ON MICHAEL\n\nThe modest champion.  He rises and they take their leave.\n\nVIEW ON THE TWO FBI AGENTS\n\nThey watch the Corleone party as they exit.\n\nINT. WASHINGTON HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY\n\nThe Corleone nurse is waiting, playing with the little girl\nMARY.  A distance away, the boy, Anthony, is standing by\nhimself.\n\nINT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - WASHINGTON HOTEL - DAY\n\nThe door to Michael's suite opens; Rocco leans in.\n\nROCCO\nIt's Kay.\n\nMichael is sitting in an easy chair; he seems to have\ndifficulty with his eyes.\n\nMICHAEL\nOn the phone?\n\nROCCO\nNo, she's here.\n\nMichael rises, surprised.  Rocco steps back, and Kay enters.\n\n\n\nMICHAEL\nI had no idea...\n\nKAY\nI wanted to see you before you went\nback to Nevada.  Also, the\nchildren - Michael, they're here.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhere?\n\nKAY\nIn a minute.  They're outside with\nEsther.  I'm very happy for you...\nI suppose I knew that you're simply\ntoo smart for anyone ever to beat\nyou.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhy don't you sit down?\n\nKAY\nI'm not going to stay long; I can't.\n\nMICHAEL\nThere are a lot of things I want to\ntalk to you about.  Things I've\nbeen thinking about -- changes I\nwant to make.\n\nKAY\nI think it's too late for changes,\nMichael.  I promised myself I\nwouldn't talk about it and I've\ngone and spoiled it.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhy too late?\n\nKAY\nTell me, Michael.  What really\nhappened with Pentangeli?\n\nMICHAEL\nHis brother came to help him.\n\nKAY\nI didn't even know he had a brother.\nAnd where is he now?\n\nMICHAEL\nOn a plane back to Sicily.\n\nKAY\nAnd that's all he had to do.  Just\nshow his face.\n\nMICHAEL\nThat's all.  You see, in Sicily, in\nthe old days... there was only one\nlegitimate reason to kill a blood\nrelative... only one.  IF he was a\ntraitor.\n\nKAY\nYou would have killed his brother?\n\nMICHAEL\nKay, you've got it wrong.  That\n\n\n\nkind of thing's all over, I promised\nyou.  This was between the two\nbrothers.  Years ago Frankie had a\nyoung girlfriend; he called her his\nco-wife.  That was his joke, but he\nmeant it.  He wouldn't divorce his\nwife... because she was a great\ncook.  He said he girlfriend made a\nspaghetti sauce once and it was so\nterrible he knew he could never\nmarry her.  He set her up in a\nhouse in Jersey.  She had to be\nfaithful... and she had to have kids.\nAnd she did, two, a boy and a girl.\nHe had her checked out and watched\nso she couldn't cheat... but the\ngirl couldn't stand that kind of\nlife.  She begged him to let her go.\nHe did.  He gave her money and made\nher give up the kids.  Then Frankie\ntook them to Italy, and had them\nbrought up by his brother Vincenzo.\nWhere he knew they'd by safe.\n\nKay begins to realize.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhen he saw his brother in the\nhearing room, he knew what was at\nstake.\n\n(pause)\nI don't think Vincenzo would have\ndone it.  He loves the kids, too.\nOmerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It\nhad nothing to do with me.  It was\nbetween those brothers.\n\nKAY\nI'll bring the children up now;\nthey want to say goodbye.\n\nMICHAEL\nKay, I told you...\n\nKAY\nGoodbye, Michael.\n\nMICHAEL\nI won't let you leave!  Christ, do\nyou think I'm going to let you leave.\n\nKAY\n(meekly)\n\nMichael.\n\nMICHAEL\nNo, I don't want to hear anything.\nThere are things between men and\nwomen that will not change; things\nthat have been the same for\nthousands of years.  You are my\nwife, and they are my children...\nand I love you and I will not let\nyou leave, because you are MINE!\n\nKAY\nOh, I do feel things for you,\nMichael; but now, I think it's pity.\nFor the first time since I've known\n\n\n\nyou, you seem so helpless.  You\nheld me a prisoner once; will you\ntry again?\n\nMICHAEL\nIf that's what it takes; then yes,\nI will.\n\nKAY\nAt this moment, I feel no love for\nyou at all.  I never thought that\ncould happen, but it has.\n\nMICHAEL\nWe'll go back tonight.  Bring the\nchildren.\n\nKAY\nYou haven't heard me.\n\nHe moves to her; he does love her, and is tender with her.\n\nMICHAEL\nHow can I let you leave; how can I\nlet you take my children away?\nDon't you know me?  You understand,\nit's an impossibility.  I would\nnever let it happen; no, never, not\nif it took all my strength, all my\ncunning.  But in time, soon, you'll\nfeel differently.

DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               The PARAMOUNT Logo is presented austerely over a black \n               background. There is a moment's hesitation, and then the \n               simple words in white lettering:\n\n                                      THE GODFATHER\n\n               While this remains, we hear: \"I believe in America.\" Suddenly \n               we are watching in CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, a man of \n               sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great emotion.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         America has made my fortune.\n\n               As he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to loosen.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         I raised my daughter in the American \n                         fashion; I gave her freedom, but \n                         taught her never to dishonor her \n                         family. She found a boy friend, not \n                         an Italian. She went to the movies \n                         with him, stayed out late. Two months \n                         ago he took her for a drive, with \n                         another boy friend. They made her \n                         drink whiskey and then they tried to \n                         take advantage of her. She resisted; \n                         she kept her honor. So they beat her \n                         like an animal. When I went to the \n                         hospital her nose was broken, her \n                         jaw was shattered and held together \n                         by wire, and she could not even weep \n                         because of the pain.\n\n               He can barely speak; he is weeping now.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         I went to the Police like a good \n                         American. These two boys were arrested \n                         and brought to trial. The judge \n                         sentenced them to three years in \n                         prison, and suspended the sentence. \n                         Suspended sentence! They went free \n                         that very day. I stood in the \n                         courtroom like a fool, and those \n                         bastards, they smiled at me. Then I \n                         said to my wife, for Justice, we \n                         must go to The Godfather.\n\n               By now, THE VIEW is full, and we see Don Corleone's office \n\n\n\n               in his home.\n\n               The blinds are closed, and so the room is dark, and with \n               patterned shadows. We are watching BONASERA over the shoulder \n               of DON CORLEONE. TOM HAGEN sits near a small table, examining \n               some paperwork, and SONNY CORLEONE stands impatiently by the \n               window nearest his father, sipping from a glass of wine. We \n               can HEAR music, and the laughter and voices of many people \n               outside.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Bonasera, we know each other for \n                         years, but this is the first time \n                         you come to me for help. I don't \n                         remember the last time you invited \n                         me to your house for coffee... even \n                         though our wives are friends.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         What do you want of me? I'll give \n                         you anything you want, but do what I \n                         ask!\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         And what is that Bonasera?\n\n               BONASERA whispers into the DON's ear.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         No. You ask for too much.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         I ask for Justice.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         The Court gave you justice.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         An eye for an eye!\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         But your daughter is still alive.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         Then make them suffer as she suffers.  \n                         How much shall I pay you.\n\n               Both HAGEN and SONNY react.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         You never think to protect yourself \n                         with real friends. You think it's \n                         enough to be an American. All right, \n                         the Police protects you, there are \n                         Courts of Law, so you don't need a \n                         friend like me. But now you come to \n                         me and say Don Corleone, you must \n                         give me justice. And you don't ask \n                         in respect or friendship. And you \n                         don't think to call me Godfather; \n                         instead you come to my house on the \n                         day my daughter is to be married and \n                         you ask me to do murder... for money.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         America has been good to me...\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Then take the justice from the judge, \n\n\n\n                         the bitter with the sweet, Bonasera.  \n                         But if you come to me with your \n                         friendship, your loyalty, then your \n                         enemies become my enemies, and then, \n                         believe me, they would fear you...\n\n               Slowly, Bonasera bows his head and murmurs.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         Be my friend.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Good. From me you'll get Justice.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         Godfather.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Some day, and that day may never \n                         come, I would like to call upon you \n                         to do me a service in return.\n\n               EXT. DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               A HIGH ANGLE of the CORLEONE MALL in bright daylight. There \n               are at least five hundred guests filling the main courtyard \n               and gardens. There is music and laughing and dancing and \n               countless tables covered with food and wine.\n\n               DON CORLEONE stands at the Gate, flanked on either side by a \n               son: FREDO and SONNY, all dressed in the formal attire of \n               the wedding party. He warmly shakes the hands, squeezes the \n               hands of the friends and guests, pinches the cheeks of the \n               children, and makes them all welcome. They in turn carry \n               with them gallons of homemade wine, cartons of freshly baked \n               bread and pastries, and enormous trays of Italian delicacies.\n\n               The entire family poses for a family portrait: DON CORLEONE, \n               MAMA, SONNY, his wife, SANDRA, and their children, TOM HAGEN \n               and his wife, THERESA, and their BABY; CONSTANZIA, the bride, \n               and her bridegroom, CARLO RIZZI. As they move into the pose, \n               THE DON seems preoccupied.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Where's Michael?\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         He'll be here Pop, it's still early.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Then the picture will wait for him.\n\n               Everyone in the group feels the uneasiness as the DON moves \n               back to the house. SONNY gives a delicious smile in the \n               direction of the Maid-of-Honor, LUCY MANCINI. She returns \n               it. Then he moves to his wife.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Sandra, watch the kids.

TOM crooks \n               a finger at NAZORINE, who double checks that he is next, \n               straightens, and follows HAGEN.\n\n\n\n               EXT DAY: MALL ENTRANCE (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               Outside the main gate of the Mall, SEVERAL MEN in suits, \n               working together with a MAN in a dark sedan, walk in and out \n               of the rows of parked cars, writing license plate numbers \n               down in their notebooks. We HEAR the music and laughter coming \n               from the party in the distance.\n\n               A MAN stops at a limousine and copies down the number.\n\n               BARZINI, dignified in a black homburg, is always under the \n               watchful eyes of TWO BODYGUARDS as he makes his way to embrace \n               DON CORLEONE in the courtyard.\n\n               The MEN walk down another row of parked cars. Put another \n               number in the notebook. A shiny new Cadillac with wooden \n               bumpers.\n\n               PETER CLEMENZA, dancing the Tarantella joyously, bumping \n               bellies with the ladies.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         Paulie... wine...

Put another \n               number in the notebook.\n\n               TESSIO, a tall, gentle-looking man, dances with a NINE-YEAR- \n               OLD GIRL, her little black party shoes planted on his enormous \n               brown shoes.\n\n               The MEN move on to other parked cars, when SONNY storms out \n               of the gate, his face flushed with anger, followed by CLEMENZA \n               and PAULIE.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Buddy, this is a private party.\n\n               The MAN doesn't answer, but points to the DRIVER of the sedan.  \n               SONNY menacingly thrusts his reddened face at him.\n\n               The DRIVER merely flips open his wallet to a greed card, \n               without saying a word. SONNY steps back, spits on the ground, \n               turns, and walks away, followed by CLEMENZA, PAULIE, and \n               another TWO MEN. He doesn't say a thing for most of the walk \n               back into the courtyard, and then, muttered to PAULIE.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Goddamn FBI... don't respect nothing.\n\n               INT.

He takes the envelope from his jacket, \n               holds it out, but does not release it until he makes a formal \n               speech.\n\n                                     LUCA\n                              (with difficulty)\n                         Don Corleone...

DON CORLEONE breathes \n               more easily, and gives the thick envelope to HAGEN.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         I'm sure it's the most generous gift \n                         today.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         The Senator called--apologized for \n                         not coming personally, but said you'd \n\n\n\n                         understand.

Sollozzo \n                         has contacts in Turkey for the poppy, \n                         in Sicily for the plants to process \n                         down to morphine or up to heroin.  \n                         Also he has access to this country.  \n                         He's coming to us for financial help, \n                         and some sort of immunity from the \n                         law.

They call \n                         Sollozzo the Turk. He's spent a lot \n                         of time in Turkey and is suppose to \n                         have a Turkish wife and kids. He's \n                         suppose to be very quick with the \n                         knife, or was, when he was younger. \n                         Only in matters of business and with \n                         some reasonable complaint. Also he \n                         has an American wife and three \n                         children and he is a good family \n                         man.\n\n               THE DON nods.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         He's his own boss, and very competent.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         And with prison record.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         Two terms; one in Italy, one in the \n                         United States. He's known to the \n                         Government as a top narcotics man.\n                         That could be a plus for us; he could \n                         never get immunity to testify.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         When did he call?\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         This morning.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         On a day like this.

The GODFATHER indicates that he come \n               with him to the office so no one will notice. He turns to \n               HAGEN.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Tell Santino to come in with us.\n\n\n\n                         He should hear some things.\n\n               They go, leaving HAGEN scanning the party looking for SONNY.\n\n               INT. DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               HAGEN glances up the staircase.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         Sonny?\n\n               Then he goes up.\n\n               INT. DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS ROOM (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               SONNY and LUCY are in a room upstairs; he has lifted her \n               gown's skirts almost over her head, and has her standing \n               against the door. Her face peeks out from the layers of \n               petticoats around it like a flower in ecstasy.\n\n                                     LUCY\n                         Sonnyeeeeeeee.\n\n               Her head bouncing against the door with the rhythm of his \n               body. But there is a knocking as well. They stop, freeze in \n               that position.\n\n                                     HAGEN (O.S.)\n                         Sonny? Sonny, you in there?\n\n               INT. DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               Outside, HAGEN by the door.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         The old man wants you; Johnny's \n                         here... he's got a problem.\n\n                                     SONNY (O.S.)\n                         Okay. One minute.\n\n               HAGEN hesitates. We HEAR LUCY's head bouncing against the \n               door again. TOM leaves.\n\n               INT. DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         ACT LIKE A MAN! By Christ in Heaven, \n                         is it possible you turned out no \n                         better than a Hollywood finocchio.\n\n               Both HAGEN and JOHNNY cannot refrain from laughing. The DON \n               smiles. SONNY enters as noiselessly as possible, still \n               adjusting his clothes.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         All right, Hollywood... Now tell me \n                         about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta \n                         who won't let you work.\n\n                                     JOHNNY\n                         He owns the studio. Just a month ago \n                         he bought the movie rights to this \n                         book, a best seller. And the main \n                         character is a guy just like me. I \n                         wouldn't even have to act, just be \n                         myself.\n\n               The DON is silent, stern.\n\n\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         You take care of your family?\n\n                                     JOHNNY\n                         Sure.\n\n               He glances at SONNY, who makes himself as inconspicuous as \n               he can.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         You look terrible. I want you to eat \n                         well, to rest. And spend time with \n                         your family. And then, at the end of \n                         the month, this big shot will give \n                         you the part you want.\n\n                                     JOHNNY\n                         It's too late. All the contracts \n                         have been signed, they're almost \n                         ready to shoot.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         I'll make him an offer he can't \n                         refuse.\n\n               He takes JOHNNY to the door, pinching his cheek hard enough \n               to hurt.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Now go back to the party and leave \n                         it to me.\n\n               He closes the door, smiling to himself. Turns to HAGEN.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         When does my daughter leave with her \n                         bridegroom?\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         They'll cut the cake in a few \n                         minutes... leave right after that.\n                         Your new son-in-law, do we give him \n                         something important?\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         No, give him a living. But never let \n                         him know the family's business. What \n                         else, Tom?\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         I've called the hospital; they've \n                         notified Consiglere Genco's family \n                         to come and wait. He won't last out \n                         the night.\n\n               This saddens the DON. He sighs.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Genco will wait for me.

But \n                         don't leave until I come back from \n                         the hospital and speak to you. \n                         Understood?\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         Understood.\n\n               EXT. DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               Now all the wedding GUESTS excitedly clap their hands over \n               the entrance of the cake: NAZORINE is beaming as he wheels \n               in a serving table containing the biggest, gaudiest, most \n               extravagant wedding cake ever baked, an incredible monument \n               of his gratitude. The CROWD is favorably impressed: they \n               begin to clink their knives or forks against their glasses, \n               in the traditional request for the Bride to cut the cake and \n               kiss the Groom. Louder and louder, five hundred forks hitting \n               five hundred glasses.\n\n               EXT. DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               Silence.\n\n               HIGH ANGLE ON THE MALL, late day. The GUESTS are gone. A \n               single black car is in the courtyard. FREDDIE is behind the \n               driver's seat: the DON enters the car, looks at MICHAEL, who \n               sits between SONNY and JOHNNY in the rear seat.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Will your girl friend get back to \n                         the city all right?\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Tom said he'd take care of it.\n\n               The DON pulls the door shut; and the car pulls out, through \n               the gate of the great Corleone Mall.\n\n               INT. DAY: HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               A long white hospital corridor, at the end of which we can \n               see a grouping of FIVE WOMEN, some old and some young, but \n               all plump and dressed in black.\n\n               DON CORLEONE and his SONS move toward the end. But then the \n               DON slows, putting his hand on MICHAEL's shoulder. MICHAEL \n               stops and turns toward his FATHER. The two looks at one \n               another for some time. SILENCE. DON CORLEONE then lifts his \n               hand, and slowly touches a particular medal on MICHAEL's \n               uniform.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         What was this for?\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         For bravery.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         And this?\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         For killing a man.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         What miracles you do for strangers.\n\n\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         I fought for my country. It was my \n                         choice.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         And now, what do you choose to do?\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         I'm going to finish school.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Good. When you are finished, come \n                         and talk to me. I have hopes for \n                         you.\n\n               Again they regard each other without a word. MICHAEL turns, \n               and continues on. DON CORLEONE watches a moment, and then \n               follows.\n\n               INT. DAY: HOSPITAL ROOM (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               DON CORLEONE enters the hospital room, moving closest to OUR \n               VIEW. He is followed by his SONS, JOHNNY and the WOMEN.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                              (whispered)\n                         Genco, I've brought my sons to pay \n                         their respects. And look, even Johnny \n                         Fontane, all the way from Hollywood.\n\n               GENCO is a tiny, wasted skeleton of a man. DON CORLEONE takes \n               his bony hand, as the others arrange themselves around his \n               bed, each clasping the other hand in turn.\n\n                                     GENCO\n                         Godfather, Godfather, it's your \n                         daughter's wedding day, you cannot \n                         refuse me.

They do.\n\n               He returns his attention to GENCO, holding his hand and \n               whispering things we cannot hear, as they wait for death.\n\n\n\n               INT. NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               The interior of a non-stop Constellation. HAGEN is one of \n               the very few passengers on this late flight. He looks like \n               any young lawyer on a business trip. He is tired from the \n               difficult preparation and duties that he has just executed \n               during the wedding. On the seat next to him is an enormous, \n               bulging briefcase. He closes his eyes.\n\n               INT. NIGHT: HONEYMOON HOTEL (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               The honeymoon hotel: CARLO and CONNIE. CARLO is in his \n               undershorts, sitting up on the bed, anxiously taking the \n               envelopes out of the silk bridal purse and counting the \n               contents. CONNIE prepares herself in the large marble \n               bathroom. She rubs her hands over his bronze shoulders, and \n               tries to get his interest.\n\n               INT. NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               DON CORLEONE in his office.

Let them \n                         believe you could be tempted away \n                         from the Corleone Family, if the \n                         right offer was made. Learn what he \n                         has under his fingernails...\n\n               INT. NIGHT: MANCINI APT. HALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               The hallway of an apartment building. SONNY enters, climbs \n               two steps at a time. He knocks, and then whispers.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         It's me, Sonny.\n\n               The door opens, and two lovely arms are around him, pulling \n               him into the apartment.\n\n               INT. NIGHT: LUCA'S ROOM (WINTER 1945)\n\n               LUCA BRASI's tiny room. He is partly dressed. He kneels and \n               reaches under his bed and pulls out a small, locked trunk.  \n               He opens it, and takes out a heavy, bullet-proof vest. He \n               puts it on, over his wool undershirt, and then puts on his \n               shirt and jacket. He takes his gun, quickly disassembles, \n               checks, and reassembles it. And leaves.\n\n               INT. NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               A CLOSE VIEW of DON CORLEONE thinking quietly.\n\n               INT.

NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)\n\n               LUCA, in his bulky jacket, sitting quietly on an empty subway \n               train.\n\n               INT. NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)\n\n\n\n               HAGEN on the Constellation. He reaches into his briefcase, \n               and takes out several pictures and papers.\n\n               One photograph is of a smiling man, JACK WOLTZ, linked arm \n               in arm with fifteen movie stars on either side, including a \n               lovely young child star to his immediate right.\n\n               HAGEN considers other papers.\n\n               INT. NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               DON CORLEONE looks, and then moves HAGEN into an embrace.  \n               He straightens his arms and looks at TOM deeply.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Remember my new Consigliere, a lawyer \n                         with his briefcase can steal more \n                         than a hundred men with guns.\n\n               EXT.

A GATEMAN opens the gate, and \n               TOM enters.\n\n               EXT. DAY: WOLTZ GARDENS (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               HAGEN and WOLTZ comfortably stroll along beautiful formal \n               gardens, martinis in hand.\n\n                                     WOLTZ\n                         You should have told me your boss \n                         was Corleone, Tom, I had to check \n                         you out. I thought you were just \n                         some third rate hustler Johnny was \n                         running in to bluff me.\n                              (a piece of statuary)\n                         Florence, thirteenth century.\n                         Decorated the garden of a king.\n\n               They cross the garden and head toward the stables.\n\n                                     WOLTZ\n                         I'm going to show you something \n                         beautiful.\n\n               They pass the stables, and come to rest by a stall with a \n               huge bronze plaque attached to the outside wall: \"KHARTOUM.\" \n               TWO SECURITY GUARDS are positioned in chairs nearby; they \n               rise as WOLTZ approaches.\n\n                                     WOLTZ\n                         You like horses?

I bet even Russian Czars \n                         never paid that kind of dough for a \n                         single horse.

NIGHT: WOLTZ DINING ROOM (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               HAGEN and WOLTZ sit at an enormous dining room table, attended \n               by SEVERAL SERVANTS. Great paintings hang on the walls. The \n               meal is elaborate and sumptuous.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather.\n\n               That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship.\n\n                                     WOLTZ\n                         Okay, but just tell him this is one \n                         favor I can't give.

Johnny Fontane never gets that \n                         movie.

And \n                         I'll tell you why. He ruined one of \n                         Woltz Brothers' most valuable \n                         proteges. For five years I had this \n                         girl under training; singing lessons!  \n                         Acting lessons! Dancing lessons! We \n                         spent hundreds of thousands of dollars--\n                         I was going to make her a star. I'll \n                         be even more frank, just to show you \n                         that I'm not a hard-hearted man, \n                         that it wasn't all dollars and cents. \n                         That girl was beautiful and young \n                         and innocent and she was the greatest \n                         piece of ass I've ever had and I've \n                         had them all over the world. Then \n                         Johnny comes along with that olive \n                         oil voice and guinea charm and she \n                         runs off. She threw it all away to \n                         make me look ridiculous. A MAN IN MY \n                         POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE MADE TO \n                         LOOK RIDICULOUS!\n\n               EXT. DAY: GENCO OLIVE OIL CO. (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               An unimposing little building in New York City on Mott Street \n               with a large old sign: \"GENCO OLIVE OIL IMPORTS, INC.\" next \n               to an open-faced fruit market.\n\n               A dark Buick pulls up, and a single small man, whom we cannot \n               see well because of the distance, gets out and enters the \n               building. This is VIRGIL SOLLOZZO.\n\n               INT. DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)\n\n\n\n               Looking toward the staircase we can hear SOLLOZZO's footsteps \n               before he actually rises into view. He is a small man, very \n               dark, with curly black hair. But wiry, and tight and hard, \n               and obviously very dangerous. He is greeted at the head of \n               the stairs by SONNY, who takes his hand and shakes it, \n               introducing himself. For a moment, there is a complex of \n               handshaking quite formal, and whispered respectful \n               introductions. Finally, SOLLOZZO is taken into the DON's \n               glass paneled office; the two principals are introduced.  \n               They are very respectful of one another. Folding chairs are \n               brought in by FREDDIE, and soon they are all sitting around \n               in a circle; the DON, SOLLOZZO, SONNY, HAGEN, FREDDIE, \n               CLEMENZA and TESSIO. The DON is the slightest bit foolish \n               with all his compatriots, whereas SOLLOZZO has brought no \n               one. Throughout all that transpires, however, it is clear \n               that this scene is between two men: SOLLOZZO and DON CORLEONE.\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         My business is heroin, I have poppy \n                         fields, laboratories in Narseilles \n                         and Sicily, ready to go into \n                         production. My importing methods are \n                         as safe as these things can be, about \n                         five per cent loss. The risk is \n                         nothing, the profits enormous.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Why do you come to me? Why do I \n                         deserve your generosity?\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         I need two million dollars in cash... \n                         more important, I need a friend who \n                         has people in high places; a friend \n                         who can guarantee that if one of my \n                         employees be arrested, they would \n                         get only light sentences.

In the first year \n                         your share would be four million \n                         dollars; then it would go up.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         And what is the percentage of the \n                         Tattaglia family?\n\n               SOLLOZZO nods toward HAGEN.\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         My compliments.

I receive 30 per cent just for \n                         finance and legal protection. No \n                         worries about operations, is that \n                         what you tell me?\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         If you think two million dollars in \n                         cash is just finance, I congratulate \n                         you Don Corleone.\n\n\n\n               There is a long silence; in which each person present feels \n               the tension. The DON is about to give his answer.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         I said I would see you because I've \n                         heard you're a serious man, to be \n                         treated with respect...\n                              (pause)\n                         But I'll say no to you.\n\n               We feel this around the room.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         I'll give you my reasons. I have \n                         many, many friends in Politics.\n                         But they wouldn't be so friendly if \n                         my business was narcotics instead of \n                         gambling. They think gambling is \n                         something like liquor, a harmless \n                         vice... and they think narcotics is \n                         dirty business.\n\n               SOLLOZZO takes a breath.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         No... how a man makes his living is \n                         none of my business. But this \n                         proposition of yours is too risky.\n                         All the people in my family lived \n                         well the last ten years, I won't \n                         risk that out of greed.\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         Are you worried about security for \n                         your million?\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         No.\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         The Tattaglias will guarantee your \n                         investment also.\n\n               This startles SONNY; he blurts out.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         The Tattaglia family guarantees our \n                         investment?\n\n               SOLLOZZO hears him first, and then very slowly turns to face \n               him. Everyone is the room knows that SONNY has stepped out \n               of line.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Young people are greedy, and they \n                         have no manners. They speak when \n                         they should listen. But I have a \n                         sentimental weakness for my children, \n                         and I've spoiled them, as you see.  \n                         But Signor Sollozzo, my no is final.\n\n               SOLLOZZO nods, understands that this is the dismissal. He \n               glances one last time at SONNY. He rises; all the others do \n               as well. He bows to the DON, shakes his hand, and formally \n               takes his leave. When the footsteps can no longer be heard:\n\n               The DON turns to SONNY.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n\n\n\n                         Santino, never let anyone outside \n                         the family know what you are thinking.  \n                         I think your brain is going soft \n                         from all that comedy you play with \n                         that young girl.\n\n               TWO OFFICE WORKERS are carrying an enormous floral display \n               with the word \"THANK YOU\" spelled out in flowers.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         What is this nonsense?\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         It's from Johnny. It was announced \n                         this morning. He's going to play the \n                         lead in the new Woltz Brothers film.\n\n               INT. DAY: WOLTZ'S BEDROOM (SUMMER 1945)\n\n               It is large, dominated by a huge bed, in which a man, \n               presumably WOLTZ, is sleeping. Soft light bathes the room \n               from the large windows. We move closer to him until we see \n               his face, and recognize JACK WOLTZ. He turns uncomfortably; \n               mutters, feels something strange in his bedsheets. Something \n               wet.\n\n               He wakens, feels the sheets with displeasure; they are wet.  \n               He looks at his hand; the wetness is blood. He is frightened, \n               pulls aside the covers, and sees fresh blood on his sheets \n               and pajamas. He grunts, pulls the puddle of blood in his \n               bed. He feels his own body frantically, moving, down, \n               following the blood, until he is face to face with the great \n               severed head of Khartoum lying at the foot of his bed. Just \n               blood from the hacked neck. White reedy tendons show. He \n               struggles up to his elbows in the puddle of blood to see \n               more clearly. Froth covers the muzzle, and the enormous eyes \n               of the animal are yellowed and covered with blood.\n\n               WOLTZ tries to scream; but cannot. No sound comes out.\n\n               Then, finally and suddenly an ear-splitting scream of pure \n               terror escapes from WOLTZ, who is rocking on his hands and \n               knees in an uncontrolled fit, blood all over him.\n\n               INT.

In the background, \n               through the glass partitions, we can see the DON, at work in \n               his office.

He puts aside the papers the office manager \n               has prepared for him, and then moves to FREDDIE, raps his \n               knuckles on his head to take his nose out of the paper.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Tell Paulie to get the car from the \n                         lot; I'll be ready to go home in a \n                         few minutes.\n\n                                     FREDO\n                         I'll have to get it myself; Paulie \n                         called in sick this morning.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         That's the third time this month.\n\n               I think maybe you'd better get a healthier bodyguard for me.  \n               Tell Tom.\n\n                                     FREDO\n                              (going)\n                         Paulie's a good kid.

DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)\n\n               The light outside is very cold, and beginning to fail. When \n               FREDDIE sees his FATHER coming, he moves back into the \n               driver's seat. The DON moves to the car, and is about to get \n               in when he hesitates, and turns back to the long, open fruit \n               stand near the corner.\n\n               The PROPRIETOR springs to serve him. The DON walks among the \n               trays and baskets, and merely points to a particular piece \n               of fruit. As he selects, the MAN gingerly picks the pieces \n               of fruit up and puts them into a paper bag. The DON pays \n               with a five dollar bill, waits for his change, and then turns \n               back to the car.\n\n               EXT.

DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)\n\n               DON CORLEONE by the fruit stand; he is about to move to the \n               car, when TWO MEN step from the corner. Suddenly, the DON \n               drops the bag of fruit and darts with startling quickness \n               toward the parked car.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Fredo, Fredo!\n\n               The paper bag has hit the ground, and the fruit begins rolling \n               along the sidewalk, as we HEAR gunshots.\n\n               Five bullets catch the DON in the back; he arches in pain, \n               and continues toward the car.\n\n               The PROPRIETOR of the fruit stand rushes for cover, knocking \n               over an entire case of fruit.\n\n               The TWO GUNMEN move in quickly, anxious to finish him off.\n\n\n\n               Their feet careful to avoid the rolling fruit. There are \n               more GUNSHOTS.\n\n               FREDDIE is hysterical; he tries to get out of the car; having \n               difficulty opening the door. He rushes out, a gun trembling \n               in his hand; his mouth open. He actually drops the gun.\n\n               The gun falls amid the rolling fruit.\n\n               The GUNMEN are panicked. They fire once more at the downed \n               DON CORLEONE. His leg and arm twitch where they are hit; and \n               pools of blood are beginning to form.\n\n               The GUNMEN are obviously in a state of panic and confusion; \n               they disappear around the corner as quickly as they came.\n\n               The PEOPLE about the avenue have all but disappeared: rather, \n               we catch glimpses of them, poking their heads safely from \n               around corners, inside doorways and arches, and from windows.  \n               But the street itself is now empty.\n\n               FREDDIE is in shock; he looks at his FATHER; now great puddles \n               of blood have formed, and the DON is lifeless and face down \n               in them.\n\n               FREDDIE falls back on to the curb and sits there, saying \n               something we cannot understand. He begins to weep profusely.\n\n               INT. NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)\n\n               LUCA BRASI riding alone on a subway car, late at night.

NITE: NIGHT CLUB STREET (WINTER 1945)\n\n               LUCA walks down the late night street. He approaches an \n               elegant New York Nightclub, whose gaudy neon sign is still \n               winking this late at night. He waits and watches. Then the \n               sign goes out; and he proceeds into the club.\n\n               INT. NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)\n\n               The main floor of the Nightclub is very large, with endless \n               glistening wooden floors. Now, at this late time, the chairs \n               have been stacked on the tables and a NEGRO JANITOR is waxing \n               them. A single HAT-CHECK GIRL is counting her receipts. LUCA \n               moves past the empty bandstand, and sits at the bar. ANOTHER \n               MAN, dark and very well-built, moves behind the bar.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Luca...

Then, he \n               does an odd thing; he drops the lighter on the bar, and puts \n               his hand lightly on LUCA's, almost patting it.\n\n               INT.

Then he controls it.\n\n               Quickly, he dials another number.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Theresa, let me talk to Tom.

You \n                         can only cause a lot of trouble. \n                         What's done is done.\n                              (a pause)\n                         Don't lose that famous temper of \n                         yours.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                              (quietly)\n                         I'll wait.\n\n               EXT. NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)\n\n               FULL VIEW OF THE CORLEONE MALL. It is night, but the courtyard \n               is bathed with white light from floodlights on the tops of \n               all the houses. It is very cold. We see the figure of SONNY \n               cross the Mall, and let himself into the main house.\n\n               INT. NITE: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)\n\n               SONNY walks into the empty, darkened house. Then he calls \n               out.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Ma? Ma, where are you.\n\n               The kitchen door swings open. He moves quickly and takes her \n               by the arm. He is deliberately calm.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Ma, I just got a call. Pop's hurt... \n                         I don't know how bad.\n\n                                     MAMA\n                              (quietly)\n                         Santino? Have they killed him?\n\n                                     SONNY\n                              (almost in tears)\n                         We don't know yet, Ma.\n\n                                     MAMA\n                         I'll get dressed. In case we can see \n\n\n\n                         him...\n\n               She moves out of the kitchen, and continues upstairs. SONNY \n               turns the gas from the pan of peppers she was frying. He \n               takes some bread without thinking, and dips it in the oil, \n               and sloppily eats some of the peppers, as he moves into his \n               father's office.\n\n               INT. NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\n\n               He switches the lights on in the DON's office. The massive \n               desk dominates the room. SONNY moves quickly to the telephone, \n               pulling a small chair to the side of the desk, and dials a \n               number.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Tessio... This is Santino Corleone. \n                         I want fifty reliable men out here.\n\n                                     TESSIO (O.S.)\n                         I heard, Sonny... but what about \n                         Clemenza's regime?\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         I don't want to use Clemenza's people \n                         right now. Understood?\n\n               He hangs up. He moves quickly to a wall safe; operates the \n               dial, and removes a small notebook. He takes it back to the \n               desk, and runs over the list of numbers with his forefinger.  \n               We follow the names, until the finger stops at one: LUCA \n               BRASI. SONNY dials the number. There is no answer.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Luca.\n\n               INT. NITE: BUILDING (WINTER 1945)\n\n               The interior of an abandoned building. SEVERAL MEN in suits \n               and ties sit around in the booths.\n\n               HAGEN sits in one: SOLLOZZO sits across from him.\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         I know you're not in the muscle end \n                         of the family--so I don't want you \n                         to be afraid. I want you to help the \n                         Corleones and I want you to help me.\n\n               HAGEN's hands are trembling as he tries to put a cigarette \n               in his mouth. ONE of the BUTTON MEN brings a bottle of rye \n               to the table, and pours a little into a delicate, flowered \n               china cup. HAGEN sips gratefully.\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         Your boss is dead...\n\n               HAGEN is overwhelmed: actual tears spring to his eyes.\n\n               SOLLOZZO pauses respectfully.\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                              (pushing the bottle)\n                         Have some more. We got him outside \n                         his office, just before I picked you \n                         up. You have to make the peace between \n                         me and Santino.\n\n               HAGEN still is focused on the grief of losing the old man.\n\n\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         Sonny was hot for my deal, right?\n                         You know it's the smart thing to do, \n                         too. I want you to talk Sonny into \n                         it.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                              (pulling himself \n                              together)\n                         Sonny will come after you with \n                         everything he's got.\n\n               SOLLOZZO rises, impatiently.\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         That's going to be his first reaction.  \n                         You have to talk some sense into \n                         him. The Tattaglia family stands \n                         behind me with all their people. The \n                         other New York Families will go along \n                         with anything that prevents a full \n                         scale war.\n\n               He leans close to HAGEN.\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         The Don was slipping; in the old \n                         days I could never have gotten to \n                         him. Now he's dead, nothing can bring \n                         him back. Talk to Sonny, talk to the \n                         Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio... \n                         it's good business.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         Even Sonny won't be able to call off \n                         Luca Brasi.\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         I'll worry about Luca. You take care \n                         of Sonny and the other two kids.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         I'll try... It's what the Don would \n                         want us to do.\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                              (lifting his hands in \n                              an expression of \n                              harmlessness)\n                         Good... then you can go...\n                              (he escorts him to \n                              the door)\n                         I don't like violence.

NITE: BUILDING\n\n               HAGEN, SOLLOZZO exit.\n\n               But a car pulls up, and ONE of SOLLOZZO'S MEN rushes out.  \n               He indicates with some urgency that he wants to talk to \n               SOLLOZZO in private.\n\n               Then SOLLOZZO moves with a grave expression. He opens the \n               door, indicating that HAGEN should be led back in.\n\n\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         The old man is still alive. Five \n                         bullets in his Sicilian hide and \n                         he's still alive.\n                              (he gives a fatalistic \n                              shrug)\n                         Bad luck for me, bad luck for you.\n\n               EXT. NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)\n\n               MICHAEL driving during the night. There is a little fog in \n               the air, and moisture has formed on the windshield, making \n               it difficult to see well. The wipers move across the view, \n               as the gate of the Corleone Mall appears before us, still \n               decorated for Christmas. The courtyard is bathed with white \n               floodlight, giving this place a cold and isolated look. The \n               narrow entrance mouth of the Mall is sealed off with a link \n               chain. There are strange cars parked along the curving cement \n               walk. SEVERAL MEN are congregated about the gate and chain; \n               ONE of them approaches MICHAEL's car.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Who're you?\n\n               ANOTHER peeks his ugly face almost right up to MICHAEL, and \n               then turns.\n\n                                     MAN 2\n                         It's the Don's kid; take the car, \n                         I'll bring him inside.\n\n               The FIRST MAN opens the car door, and MICHAEL steps out.\n\n               INT. NITE: HALL (WINTER 1945)\n\n               The Hallway of the main house is filled with MEN MICHAEL \n               doesn't recognize. They pay little attention to him. Most of \n               them are waiting; sitting uncomfortably; no one is talking.\n\n               INT. NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)\n\n               MICHAEL moves into the living room; there is a Christmas \n               tree, and countless greeting cards taped to the walls.\n\n               THERESA HAGEN is sitting stiffly on the sofa, smoking a \n               cigarette; on the coffee table in front of her is a water \n               glass half filled with whiskey. On the other side of the \n               sofa sits CLEMENZA; his face is impassive, but he is sweating, \n               and the cigar in his hand glistens slickly black with his \n               saliva. PAULIE GATTO sits tensely and alone on the other \n               side of the room. CLEMENZA sees MICHAEL, looks up at him.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         Your mother's at the hospital with \n                         the old man: He's gonna pull through.\n\n               MICHAEL nods his relief.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Thanks.\n\n               He moves to THERESA.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                              (gently)\n                         You heard from Tom yet?\n\n               Without looking up, she clings to him for a moment, and \n\n\n\n               trembles. Occasionally, STRANGE MEN will cross through the \n               room; everyone speaks in a whisper.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                              (taking her hand)\n                         C'mon.\n\n               He leads her into his father's office without knocking.\n\n               INT. NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\n\n               SONNY and TESSIO are huddled around a yellow pad.

He dials Luca \n               Brasi's number once again. The ring repeats, but no one \n               answers.\n\n               TESSIO comes back, carrying Luca Brasi's bullet-proof vest \n               in his hand. He unwraps it; there is a large fish wrapped \n               inside.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         A Sicilian message: Luca Brasi sleeps \n                         with the fishes.\n\n               INT. NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)\n\n               LUCA sits at the Bar of the Tattaglia Nightclub, as we \n               remember him. BRUNO TATTAGLIA had just patted his hand.  \n               LUCA looks up at him.\n\n               Then SOLLOZZO pats the other hand, almost affectionately.\n\n               LUCA is just about to twist his hands away, when they both \n               clamp down as hard as they can. Suddenly, a garrote is thrown \n               around his neck, and pulled violently tight. His face begins \n               to turn to purple blotches, and then totally purple, right \n               before our eyes; his tongue hangs out, in a far more extreme \n               way than a normal tongue could. His eyes bulge.\n\n               ONE of the MEN looks down at him in disgust as LUCA's strength \n               leaves him.\n\n                                     BRUNO\n                              (making an ugly face)\n                         Oh Christ... all over the floor.\n\n\n\n               SOLLOZZO lets LUCA's hand go with a victorious smile on his \n               face.\n\n               LUCA falls to the floor.\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         The Godfather is next.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               EXT. DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)\n\n               Morning in a simple Brooklyn suburb. There are rows of \n               pleasant houses; driveway after driveway, down the block. A \n               dark, somber young man of thirty-one or two walks with a \n               noticeable limp down the sidewalk, and rings the bell. This \n               is ROCCO LAMPONE. The woman of the house, MRS. CLEMENZA, \n               talks to him through the screen door, and then points to the \n               side of the house. ROCCO moves to the garage, which is \n               specially heated, and in which CLEMENZA is busy at work \n               washing a shiny brand new Lincoln. LAMPONE admires the car.\n\n                                     LAMPONE\n                         Nice.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         Crazy Detroit delivered it with a \n                         wooden bumper. They're going to send \n                         me the chrome bumpers in a couple \n                         months. I waited two years for this \n                         car to come with wooden bumpers!\n\n               He scrubs and polishes with great affection.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         Today you make your bones on Paulie.\n                         You understand everything?\n\n                                     LAMPONE\n                         Sure.\n\n               As he scrubs around the glove compartment, he opens it, \n               unwraps a gun and gives it to LAMPONE.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         .22 soft-nosed load. Accurate up to \n                         five feet.\n\n               LAMPONE expertly puts the gun away. GATTO's car pulls into \n               the driveway, and he sounds the horn.\n\n               The two men walk to the car. GATTO is driving, a bit nervous, \n               like he doesn't know what is up. LAMPONE gets in the rear \n               seat; CLEMENZA in the front, making a grunt of recognition.  \n               He looks at his wristwatch, as though wanting to chide PAULIE \n               for being late. PAULIE flinches a little when he sees LAMPONE \n               will ride behind him; he half turns:\n\n                                     PAULIE\n                         Rocco, sit on the other side. A big \n                         guy like you blocks my rearview \n                         mirror.\n\n               CLEMENZA turns sourly to PAULIE.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n\n\n\n                         Goddamn Sonny. He's running scared.\n                         He's already thinking of going to \n                         the mattresses. We have to find a \n                         place on the West Side. Paulie, you \n                         know a good location?\n\n               PAULIE relaxes a bit; he thinks he's off any possible hook \n               he was on. Also there's the money he can make by selling \n               Sollozzo any secret location.\n\n                                     PAULIE\n                         I'll think about it.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                              (grunting)\n                         Drive while you thinking; I wanna \n                         get to the City this month!\n\n               The car pulls out.\n\n               EXT. DAY: PAULIE'S CAR - ON ROAD (WINTER 1945)\n\n               Inside PAULIE drives; and CLEMENZA sits in a grump. OUR VIEW \n               does not show LAMPONE in the rear seat.\n\n               EXT. DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)\n\n               The Car crosses to the Midtown Tunnel in the late Winter \n               light.\n\n               INT. DAY: PAULIE'S CAR IN TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)\n\n               Inside the tunnel; GATTO doesn't like not seeing LAMPONE.\n\n               He tries to adjust his rearview mirror to catch a glimpse of \n               him.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         Pay attention!\n\n               EXT. DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)\n\n               The car is parked in the City. PAULIE comes down from an \n               available apartment and gets back into the car.\n\n                                     PAULIE\n                         Good for ten men...\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose \n                         to call when I found somethin'.\n\n               The car pulls off.\n\n               EXT. DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)\n\n               New part of the city; the car pulls up in a parking lot.\n\n               CLEMENZA get outs, glances at LAMPONE, then to PAULIE.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         You wait; I'll call.\n\n               He walks, tucking his shirt into his pants, around the corner \n               and enters the Luna Restaurant.\n\n               INT. DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)\n\n               CLEMENZA enters the little restaurant, sits down at a table.  \n\n\n\n               The WAITERS know him; immediately put a bottle of wine, some \n               bread--and then a plate of veal on his table. He eats.\n\n               EXT. DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)\n\n               CLEMENZA exits the restaurant, belches, adjusts his pants; \n               he is well fed.\n\n               We move with him around the corner, not knowing what to expect \n               has happened to Paulie.\n\n               There is the car; PAULIE is still sitting behind the wheel, \n               LAMPONE in the rear seat. CLEMENZA steps in.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         He talked my ear off. Want us to go \n                         back to Long Beach; have another job \n                         for us. Rocco, you live in the City, \n                         can we drop you off?\n\n                                     LAMPONE (O.S.)\n                         Ah, I left my car at your place.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         OK, then you gotta come back.\n\n               The car pulls out. By now, PAULIE is completely relaxed and \n               secure.\n\n                                     PAULIE\n                         You think we'll go for that last \n                         place?\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         Maybe, or you gotta know now.\n\n                                     PAULIE\n                         Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.\n\n               EXT. DAY: PAULIE'S CAR ON CAUSEWAY (WINTER 1945)\n\n               The car moves along the ready beach area of the causeway.\n\n               Inside, CLEMENZA turns to PAULIE.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         Paulie, pull over. I gotta take a \n                         leak.\n\n               The car pulls off the Causeway, into the reeds. CLEMENZA \n               steps out of the car, OUR VIEW MOVING with him.\n\n               He turns his back three quarters from us (we can no longer \n               see the car), unzips, and we hear the sound of urine hitting \n               the ground. We wait on this for a moment; and then there are \n               two GUNSHOTS. CLEMENZA finishes his leak, zips up and turns, \n               moving back to the car.\n\n               PAULIE is dead, bleeding from the mouth; the windows behind \n               him are shattered.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         Leave the gun.\n\n               LAMPONE gets out, the two men walk through the reeds a few \n               feet where there is another car. They get in, and drive off.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n\n\n               EXT. DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)\n\n               HIGH ANGLE OF THE MALL. It is late afternoon. Many strange \n               cars are parked on the nearby streets. We can see the group \n               of BUTTON MEN, stationed here and there, obviously sentries \n               with concealed weapons.\n\n               MICHAEL walks along in the rear yard.\n\n               He is bundled in a warm marine coat. He looks at the strange \n               men, regarding them with an uncertain awe. They look back at \n               him, at first suspiciously and then with the respect of his \n               position. He is like an exile Prince. He wanders past them, \n               and hesitates and looks at the yard.\n\n               A rusted set of garden swings; and other home playground \n               equipment. The basketball ring now half coming off. This is \n               where he was a child. Then a shout.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA (O.S.)\n                         Mike. Hey Mikey; telephone.\n\n               CLEMENZA had shouted from the kitchen window. MICHAEL hurries \n               into the house.\n\n               INT. DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)\n\n               CLEMENZA is in the kitchen, cooking over an enormous pot.  \n               He points to the kitchen wall phone which is hanging off the \n               hook.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         Some dame.\n\n               MICHAEL picks it up.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Hello.

NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)\n\n               A taxi pulls up in front of a hospital, marked clearly with \n               a neon sign \"HOSPITAL--EMERGENCY.\" MICHAEL steps out, pays \n               the fare... and then stops dead in his tracks.\n\n               MICHAEL looks.\n\n               He sees the hospital in the night; but it is deserted. He is \n               the only one on the street. There are gay, twinkling Christmas \n               decorations all over the building. He walks, slowly at first, \n               and then ever so quickly, up the steps. He hesitates, looks \n               around. This area is empty. He checks the address on a scrap \n               of paper. It is correct. He tries the door, it is empty.\n\n\n\n               He walks in.\n\n               INT. NITE: HOSPITAL LOBBY (WINTER 1945)\n\n               MICHAEL stands in the center of an absolutely empty hospital \n               lobby. He looks to the right; there is a long, empty corridor.  \n               To the left: the same.\n\n               HIGH FULL ANGLE, as MICHAEL walks through the desolated \n               building lit by eerie green neon lighting. All we hear are \n               his sole footsteps.\n\n               He walks up to a desk marked \"INFORMATION\". No one is there.  \n               He moves quickly to a door marked \"OFFICE\"; swings into it; \n               no one is there. He looks onto the desk: There is half a \n               sandwich, and a half-filled bottle of coke.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Hello? Hello?\n\n               Now he knows something is happening, he moves quickly, \n               alertly. MICHAEL walking down the hospital corridors; all \n               alone. The floors have just been mopped. They are still wet.\n\n               INT NITE: HOSPITAL STAIRS\n\n               Now he turns onto a staircase; ever quickening; up several \n               flights.\n\n               INT. NITE: 4TH FLOOR CORRIDOR\n\n               He steps out onto the fourth floor. He looks. There are merely \n               empty corridors. He takes out his scrap of paper; checks it.  \n               \"Room 4A.\" Now he hurries, trying to follow the code of \n               hospital rooms; following the right arrows, quicker and \n               quicker they flash by him. Now he stops, looks up \"4A-- \n               Corleone\".\n\n               There is a special card table set up there with some \n               magazines... and some smoking cigarettes still in the ashtray--\n               but no detectives, no police, no bodyguards.\n\n               INT. NITE: DON'S ROOM\n\n               Slowly he pushes the door open, almost afraid at what he \n               will find. He looks. Lit by the moonlight through the window, \n               he can see a FIGURE in the hospital bed alone in the room, \n               and under a transparent oxygen tent. All that can be heard \n               is the steady though strained breathing. Slowly MICHAEL walks \n               up to it, and is relieved to see his FATHER, securely asleep.  \n               Tubes hang from a steel gallows beside the bed, and run to \n               his nose and mouth.\n\n                                     VOICE (O.S.)\n                         What are you doing here?\n\n               This startles MICHAEL; who almost jumps around. It is a NURSE \n               lit from the light behind her in the hallway.\n\n                                     NURSE\n                         You're not supposed to be here now.\n\n               MICHAEL calms himself, and moves to her.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         I'm Michael Corleone--this is my \n                         father. What happened to the \n                         detectives who were guarding him?\n\n\n\n                                     NURSE\n                         Oh your father just had too many \n                         visitors. It interfered with the \n                         hospital service. The police came \n                         and made them all leave just ten \n                         minutes ago.\n                              (comfortingly)\n                         But don't worry.

None of \n                         Tessio's people--no detectives, no \n                         one.

You've seen that no one's \n                         here to guard him. Now I've just \n                         gotten word that men are coming to \n                         this hospital to kill him.

MICHAEL peeks \n               out from the door. The footsteps are louder; then they emerge.  \n               It is ENZO, NAZORINE's helper, carrying a bouquet of flowers.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                              (stepping out)\n                         Who is it?\n\n                                     ENZO\n                         Michael... do you remember me, Enzo, \n                         the baker's helper to Nazorine, now \n                         his son-in-law.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Enzo, get out of here.

They both stand \n               under a lamppost in the cold December night. They are both \n               frightened; MICHAEL gives ENZO a cigarette, lights it.

MICHAEL and \n               ENZO look with fear in their eyes. Then MICHAEL takes the \n               bouquet of flowers and stuffs them under his jacket.\n\n               They stand, hands in their pockets.\n\n               A long low black car turns the corner and cruises by them.\n\n               MICHAEL's and ENZO's faces are tough, impassive. The car \n               seems as though it will stop; and then quickly accelerates.\n\n               MICHAEL and ENZO are relieved. MICHAEL looks down; the BAKER's \n               hands are shaking. He looks at his own, and they are not.\n\n               Another moment goes by and we can hear the distant sound of \n               police sirens. They are clearly coming toward the hospital, \n               getting louder and louder. MICHAEL heaves a sigh of relief.\n\n               In a second, a patrol car makes a screaming turn in front of \n               the hospital; then two more squad cars follow with uniformed \n               POLICE and DETECTIVES. He smiles his relief and starts toward \n               them. TWO huge, burly POLICEMEN suddenly grab his arms while \n               ANOTHER frisks him. A massive POLICE CAPTAIN, spattered with \n               gold braid and scrambled eggs on his hat, with beefy red \n               face and white hair seems furious. This is McCLUSKEY.\n\n                                     MCCLUSKEY\n                         I thought I got all you guinea hoods \n                         locked up.

MICHAEL \n               groans, and lifts his hand to his jaw. He looks at McCLUSKEY; \n               we are his VIEW and everything goes spinning, and he falls \n               to the ground, just as we see HAGEN and CLEMENZA'S MEN arrive.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               EXT. DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)\n\n               HIGH ANGLE VIEW of THE CORLEONE MALL. The gateway now has a \n               long black car blocking it. There are more BUTTON MEN \n               stationed more formally; and some of them visibly carrying \n               rifles; those of the houses close to the courtyard have MEN \n               standing by open windows. It is clear that the war is \n               escalating. A car pulls up and out get CLEMENZA, LAMPONE, \n               MICHAEL and HAGEN. MICHAEL's jaw is wired and bandaged. He \n               stops and looks up at the open window. We can see MEN holding \n               rifles.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Christ, Sonny really means business.\n\n               They continue walking. TESSIO joins them. The various \n               BODYGUARDS make no acknowledgment.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         How come all the new men?\n\n                                     TESSIO\n                         We'll need them now. After the \n                         hospital incident, Sonny got mad.\n                         We hit Bruno Tattaglia four o'clock \n                         this morning.\n\n               INT.

You just help me win.  \n                         Understood?\n\n               HAGEN bows his head; he is deeply concerned.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         I found out about this Captain \n                         McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's \n                         definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, \n                         and for big money. McCluskey's agreed \n                         to be the Turk's bodyguard. What you \n                         have to understand is that while \n                         Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's \n                         invulnerable. Nobody has ever gunned \n                         down a New York Police Captain. Never. \n                         It would be disastrous. All the five \n                         families would come after you Sonny; \n                         the Corleone family would be outcasts; \n                         even the old man's political \n                         protection would run for cover. So \n                         just... take that into consideration.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                              (still fuming)\n                         McCluskey can't stay with the Turk \n                         forever.

No matter what Sollozzo \n                         say about a deal, he's figuring out \n                         how to kill Pop. You have to get \n                         Sollozzo now.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         The kid's right.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         What about McCluskey?\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Let's say now that we have to kill \n                         McCluskey. We'll clear that up through \n                         our Newspaper contacts later.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Go on Mike.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         They want me to go to the conference \n                         with Sollozzo. Set up the meeting \n                         for two days from now. Sonny, get \n                         our informers to find out where the \n                         meeting will be held. Insist it has \n                         to be a public place: a bar or \n                         restaurant at the height of the dinner \n                         hour. So I'll feel safe. They'll \n                         check me when I meet them so I won't \n                         be able to carry a weapon; but \n                         Clemenza, figure out a way to have \n                         one planted there for me.\n                              (pause)\n                         Then I'll kill them both.\n\n               Everyone in the room is astonished; they all look at MICHAEL.  \n               Silence. SONNY suddenly breaks out in laughter. He points a \n               finger at MICHAEL, trying to speak.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         You?

There are empty \n               booths along the side walls; with a handful of CUSTOMERS, \n               and ONE or TWO WAITERS. It is very quiet.\n\n                                     MCCLUSKEY\n                         Is the Italian food good here?\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         Try the veal; it's the finest in New \n                         York.\n\n               The solitary WAITER brings a bottle of wine to the table.\n\n               They watch him silently as he uncorks it and pours three \n               glasses. Then, when he leaves, SOLLOZZO turns to McCLUSKEY:\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         I am going to talk Italian to Mike.\n\n                                     MCCLUSKEY\n                         Sure, you two go right ahead; I'll \n                         concentrate on my veal and my \n                         spaghetti.\n\n               SOLLOZZO now begins in rapid Sicilian. MICHAEL listening \n               carefully and nodding every so often. Then MICHAEL answers \n               in Sicilian, and SOLLOZZO goes on. The WAITER occasionally \n               brings food; and they hesitate while he is there; then go \n               on.\n\n               Then MICHAEL, having difficulty expressing himself in Italian, \n               accidentally lapses into English.\n\n\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                              (using English for \n                              emphasis)\n                         Most important... I want a sure \n                         guarantee that no more attempts will \n                         be made on my father's life.\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         What guarantees can I give you? I am \n                         the hunted one. I've missed my chance.  \n                         You think too highly of me, my \n                         friend... I am not so clever... all \n                         I want is a truce...\n\n               MICHAEL looks long and hard at SOLLOZZO, who is smiling \n               holding his open hands up as if to say: \"I have no tricks up \n               my sleeve\". Then he looks away and makes a distressed look \n               on his face.\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         What is it?\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Is it all right if I go to the \n                         bathroom?\n\n               SOLLOZZO is intuitively suspicious. He studies MICHAEL with \n               his dark eyes. Then he thrusts his hand onto MICHAEL's thigh \n               feeling in and around, searching for a weapon.\n\n                                     MCCLUSKEY\n                         I frisked him; I've frisked thousands \n                         of young punks; he's clean.\n\n               He looks at a MAN sitting at a table opposite them; indicating \n               the bathroom with his eyes. The MAN nods, indicating no one \n               is there.\n\n                                     SOLLOZZO\n                         Don't take too long.\n\n               MICHAEL gets up and calmly walks to the bathroom, and \n               disappears inside.\n\n               INT. NITE: LUNA AZURA TOILET (WINTER 1945)\n\n               MICHAEL steps into the small bathroom; he is breathing very \n               hard. He actually uses the urinal. Then he washes his hands \n               with the bar of pink soap; and dries them thoroughly. Then \n               he moves to the booth, up to the old-fashioned toilet.\n\n               Slowly he reaches behind the water tank; he panics when he \n               cannot feel the gun. We see behind the tank his hand is just \n               a few inches from the gun... he gropes searchingly... finally \n               coming to rest on the gun.\n\n               CLOSE ON MICHAEL; the feel of it reassures him. Then he breaks \n               it loose from the tape holding it; he takes a deep breath \n               and shoves it under his waistband. For some unexplainable \n               reason he hesitates once again, deliberately washes his hands \n               and dries them. Then he goes out.\n\n               INT. NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)\n\n               He hesitates by the bathroom door; and looks at his table.\n\n               McCLUSKEY is eating a plate of spaghetti and veal. SOLLOZZO \n               turns around upon hearing the door, and looks directly at \n               MICHAEL. MICHAEL looks back. Then he smiles and continues \n\n\n\n               back to the table. He sits down.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Now I can talk. I feel much better.\n\n               The MAN by the far wall had been stiff with attention; now \n               he too relaxes. SOLLOZZO leans toward MICHAEL who sits down \n               comfortably and his hands move under the table and unbutton \n               his jacket.  SOLLOZZO begins to speak in Sicilian once again \n               but MICHAEL's heart is pounding so hard he can barely hear \n               him.\n\n               The WAITER comes to ask about the order, SOLLOZZO turns to \n               speak, and without warning, MICHAEL shoves the table away \n               from him with his left hand, and with his right hand puts \n               the gun right against SOLLOZZO's head, just touching his \n               temple. He pulls the trigger, and we see part of SOLLOZZO's \n               head blown away, and a spray of fine mist of blood cover the \n               entire area.\n\n               The WAITER looks in amazement; suddenly his white jacket is \n               sprayed and stained with blood.\n\n               SOLLOZZO seems in a perpetual fall to the floor; through he \n               seems to hang in space suspended.\n\n               MICHAEL pivots, and looks:\n\n               There is McCLUSKEY, frozen, the fork with a piece of veal \n               suspended in air before his gaping mouth.\n\n               MICHAEL fires; catching McCLUSKEY in his thick bulging throat.  \n               He makes a horrible, gagging, choking sound. Then coolly, \n               and deliberately, MICHAEL fires again, fires right through \n               McCLUSKEY's white-topped skull.\n\n               The air is filled with pink mist. MICHAEL swings toward the \n               MAN standing by the bathroom wall.\n\n               He does not make a move, seemingly paralyzed.\n\n               Now he carefully shows his hands to be empty.\n\n               The WAITER steps backward through the mist of blood, an \n               expression of horror on his face.\n\n               MICHAEL looks at his two victims:\n\n               SOLLOZZO still in his chair, side of his body propped up by \n               the table.\n\n               McCLUSKEY finally falls from the chair to the table.\n\n               MICHAEL is wildly at a peak. He starts to move out. His hand: \n               is frozen by his side, STILL GRIPPING THE GUN.\n\n               He moves, not letting the gun go.\n\n               MICHAEL's face; frozen in its expression.\n\n               His hand: still holding the gun.\n\n               His face: finally he closes his eyes.\n\n               His hand relaxes, the gun falls to the floor with a dull \n               thud.\n\n               He walks quickly out of the restaurant, looks back.\n\n\n\n               He sees a frozen tableau of the murder; as though it had \n               been recreated in wax.\n\n               Then he leaves.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               INT. DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)\n\n               A MAN is his shirtsleeves plays a sentimental tune on an old \n               upright piano, while his cigarette burns on the edge.\n\n               ANOTHER stands nearby, listening quietly.\n\n               A little distance away, TEN MEN sit around a crude table, \n               quietly eating. They talk in low, relaxed voices, and there \n               is an occasional laugh.\n\n               ROCCO LAMPONE stands by a window, which has been covered \n               with a heavy-mesh wire grating, gazing out.\n\n               A large bowl of pasta is passed, and the MEN eat heartily.\n\n               The sentimental tune is continued over the following:\n\n               INT. DAY: BODIES IN CAR (WINTER 1945)\n\n               A MAN and a WOMAN, blood coming out of their noses, lie still \n               together in a bullet-riddled automobile.\n\n               INT. DAY: BODY IN BARBER SHOP (WINTER 1945)\n\n               A MAN is covered by a sheet on the floor of a barber shop.\n\n               INT. DAY: MATTRESS\n\n               Ten mattresses are spread out around the otherwise empty \n               living room of an apartment. THREE or FOUR MEN including \n               CLEMENZA, are taking naps.\n\n               An arsenal of hand guns are spread out on a card table.\n\n               The MEN at the table continue their dinner; passing and \n               pouring the wine.\n\n               Trash is thrown in 2 or 3 garbage cans kept in the apartment.\n\n               INT. DAY: BODY IN OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\n\n               A MAN, his clothes soaked in blood, lies on the floor of an \n               office building, dead, under an enormous portrait of Harry \n               S. Truman.\n\n               EXT. DAY: BODY ON STOOP (WINTER 1945)\n\n               ANOTHER MAN, his trousers soaked in blood, lies spanning \n               three steps of a front stoop.\n\n               INT. NITE: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)\n\n               TESSIO, sits in a simple straight-backed chair, doing a \n               crossword puzzle.\n\n               A thin, boyish BUTTON MAN, writes a letter.\n\n               Six or seven empty mattresses, with tossed unmade blankets.\n\n\n\n               Coffee cans beside them serve as ash trays.\n\n               A MAN by the table pulls the cork on another bottle of \n               Ruffino, and wine is poured as the MEN eat.\n\n               EXT. DAY: BODY IN ALLEY (WINTER 1945)\n\n               A CORPSE is half out of an overturned garbage can in a quiet \n               alley.\n\n               INT. DAY: BODY AT TABLE (WINTER 1945)\n\n               A MAN in a formal jacket and tie is slumped over a table, in \n               a pool of blood on the tablecloth.\n\n               INT. DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)\n\n               A neatly stacked pile of newspapers in the corner of an \n               apartment. We catch a glimpse of one headline: \"Five Family \n               War...\"\n\n               The table. The MEN are sitting around cracking nuts. ONE has \n               fallen asleep on his arms at the table.\n\n               SEVERAL MEN are taking naps on the Mattresses.\n\n               The PIANO PLAYER finishes the tune with finesse. Picks up \n               and takes a drag from his cigarette. The OTHER MAN nods \n               appreciatively.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Nice Augie... nice.\n\n               EXT. DAY: MANCINI BLDG. (SPRING '46)\n\n               Several cars are parked in front of a pleasant New York \n               apartment building. We recognize a couple of SONNY's \n               bodyguards loafing by the cars, pitching playing cards against \n               the curb.\n\n               Inside the building, two others wait quietly by the rows of \n               brass mailboxes: they have been there quite awhile.\n\n               Up one flight of stairs, a single man sits on the step, \n               smoking a cigarette.\n\n               One of the men by the mailboxes checks his pocketwatch, which \n               is attached to a key chain. We HEAR the sound of a door \n               opening; they look up.\n\n               The man sitting on the stop stands; and looks.\n\n               SONNY backs out of an apartment, the arms of LUCY MANCINI \n               wrapped around him. She doesn't want to let go of him; she \n               draws him back into the apartment for a moment, and then he \n               comes out alone, adjusting his clothes.\n\n               He jauntily skips down the steps, trailed by the bodyguard \n               on the first floor, and moves outside toward his car. The \n               men quickly take up their positions. As he gets in his car:\n\n                                     DRIVER\n                         Pick up your sister?\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Yeah.\n\n               The car drives off; accompanied and escorted by the bodyguards \n               in their cars.\n\n\n\n               INT. DAY: CONNIE'S HALL (SPRING '46)\n\n               He knocks on the door. No answer. Then again.\n\n                                     CONNIE'S VOICE\n                         Who is it?\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         It's me, Sonny.\n\n               We hear the bolt slide back, and see the door open. SONNY \n               enters, but CONNIE has quickly moved into the hallway, her \n               back to him.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                              (tenderly)\n                         Connie, what is it?\n\n               He turns her around in his arms.\n\n               Her face is swollen and bruised; and we can tell from her \n               rough, red eyes that she has been crying for a long time.  \n               As soon as he realizes what's happened, his face goes red \n               with rage. She sees it coming, and clings to him, preventing \n               him from running out of the apartment.\n\n                                     CONNIE\n                              (desperately)\n                         It was my fault! I started a fight \n                         with him and I tried to hit him so \n                         he hit me. He didn't even try to hit \n                         me hard Sonny, I walked into it.\n\n               Sonny listens, and calms himself. He touches her shoulder, \n               the thin silk robe.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         I'm goin' to have the doctor come \n                         over and take a look at you.\n\n               He starts to leave.\n\n                                     CONNIE\n                         Oh Sonny, please don't do anything.\n                         Please don't.\n\n               He stops, and then laughs good naturedly.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Hey. Con. What'm I goin' to do? Make \n                         your kid a orphan before he's born.\n\n               She laughs with him. He kisses her reassuringly, and leaves.\n\n               EXT. DAY: CONNIE'S STREET\n\n               CARLO settles down on the front steps of the 112th St. \"Book\" \n               with SALLY RAGS and COACH, who have been drinking beer out \n               of glasses and a pitcher of beer from around the corner. The \n               ball game is blaring from the radio; and the kids on the \n               street are still playing stickball.\n\n               CARLO has barely settled down, when the kids in the street \n               suddenly scatter, and a car comes screeching up the block \n               and to a halt in front of the candy store. The tires scream, \n               and before it seems as though it has even stopped, a MAN \n               comes hurtling out of the driver's seat, moving so fast the \n               everyone is paralyzed. It is a moment before we recognize \n\n\n\n               that it is SONNY.\n\n               His face is contorted with anger; in a split second he is on \n               the stoop and has CARLO by the throat.\n\n               He pulls CARLO away from the others, trying to get him down \n               into the street. But CARLO reaches out for the iron railing, \n               and hangs on, his hand in a lock, cringing away, trying to \n               hide his head and face in the hollow of the his shoulders. \n               His shirt is ripped away in SONNY's hand.\n\n               SALLY RAGS and COACH, merely sit, watching, stunned.\n\n               SONNY is pounding the cowered CARLO with all his strength, \n               in a continuous monologue of indistinguishable cursing. His \n               blows are powerful; and begin to draw blood.\n\n               The kids who have been playing stickball, move up, watching \n               in fascination.\n\n               CARLO's hands are clenched tight around the railing.\n\n               SONNY beats him mercilessly.\n\n               Now SONNY's bodyguards' car pulls up, and they too become \n               spectators.\n\n               SONNY's tight fists are going down like hammers, into CARLO's \n               face and body.\n\n               CARLO's nose is bleeding profusely; but still he does nothing, \n               other than hang onto the railing.\n\n               SONNY grabs hold of CARLO's massive body, and tries to drag \n               him off of the hold on the railing, his teeth clenched in \n               the effort. Then he tries loosening CARLO's locked hands; \n               even biting them. CARLO screams but he does not let go.\n\n               It's clear that CARLO is much stronger than he is, and will \n               not be moved. SONNY knees him in the mouth, and beats him \n               more; but he is exhausted. Totally out of breath, he stammers \n               haltingly to the bleeding CARLO.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         You... bastard... You... hurt my \n                         sister... again... and I'll kill... \n                         you.\n\n               He wipes the sweat from his face, and then turns suddenly \n               and hurries back to the car, in a moment his car is gone, \n               leaving even his bodyguards in confusion. We notice ONE MAN \n               with a sports jacket in the group of spectators especially \n               interested.\n\n               CARLO finally relaxes the clenched, locked hands. He slumps \n               onto the stoop.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               EXT. DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)\n\n               HIGH ANGLE on the Corleone Mall. It is a gray, rainy day.  \n               Young BUTTON MEN in raincoats stand in quiet groups of various \n               points around the main house and compound. Things have \n               changed; one house has been extensively enlarged; a new and \n               secure gate house has been built. Security measures that had \n               been make-shift and temporarily have now been made a permanent \n\n\n\n               part of the Mall, evolving it into a Medieval Fortress. We \n               notice a huge crater in the courtyard; the result of a recent \n               bomb attempt. The house nearest the crater is damaged by \n               fire.\n\n               A taxi arrives; KAY ADAMS steps out, huddled in a bright \n               yellow raincoat; she lets the cab go, and hurries to the \n               shelter of the gate house.\n\n               They are not expecting her, and ask her to wait while they \n               call the main house.\n\n               KAY looks at the imposing, depressing Mall, while rain still \n               runs down onto her face.\n\n               She notices the bomb crater, and the fire damage; and the \n               sullen faces of the BUTTON MEN.\n\n               TOM HAGEN exits the Main House, and hurries toward her.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         Kay, we weren't expecting you.

We know \n                         he's all right, but that's all.\n\n               KAY looks in the direction of the crater, filling with \n               rainwater.\n\n                                     KAY\n                         What was that?\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         An accident.

I'm sorry.\n\n               They hurry through the rain and into the Main House.\n\n               INT. DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\n               In the living room, KAY shakes the water from her coat and \n               takes her rainhat off.\n\n                                     KAY\n                         Will you give this to him.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         If I accept that letter and you told \n                         a Court of Law I accepted it, they \n                         would interpret it as my having \n                         knowledge of his whereabouts. Just \n                         wait Kay, he'll contact you.\n\n               We hear footsteps descending the staircase; MAMA CORLEONE \n\n\n\n               enters the room; the OLD WOMAN squints at KAY, evaluating \n               her.\n\n                                     MAMA\n                         You're Mikey's little girl.\n\n               KAY nods yes; there are still tears in her eyes.\n\n                                     MAMA\n                         You eat anything?\n\n               KAY shakes her head.\n\n                                     MAMA\n                              (to HAGEN)\n                         Disgrazia, you don't even give the \n                         poor girl a cup of coffee?\n\n               HAGEN shrugs helplessly; on an impulse, KAY quickly moves \n               toward MAMA, the letter extended.\n\n                                     KAY\n                         Will you give this letter to Michael.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         Mama, no.\n\n                                     MAMA\n                         You tell me what to do? Even he don't \n                         tell me what to do.\n\n               She takes the letter from KAY, who is grateful and relieved.\n\n                                     KAY\n                         Why did they blame Michael?\n\n                                     MAMA\n                         You listen to me, you go home to \n                         your family, and you find a good \n                         young man and get married. Forget \n                         about Mikey; he's no good for you, \n                         anymore.\n\n               She looks directly into KAY's eyes; and KAY understands what \n               that means.\n\n               EXT. DAY: DON'S HOSPITAL (SPRING 1946)\n\n               A hospital in New York City. POLICE and teams of PRIVATE \n               DETECTIVES are stationed guarding the area. An ambulance \n               with a team of DETECTIVES and BUTTON-MEN GUARDS exit the \n               hospital with rifles in hand; followed by SEVERAL HOSPITAL \n               ASSISTANTS wheeling a hospital stretcher, presumably carrying \n               the DON.\n\n               TESSIO and CLEMENZA emerge, with OTHER BUTTON MEN bringing \n               up the rear. HAGEN walks with the stretcher, and for a moment \n               they disappear behind the ambulance. Then suddenly, siren \n               blasting, it speeds off, accompanied by dark low-slung cars.\n\n               EXT. DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)\n\n               The Corleone Mall.\n\n               Equally impressive security stands ready at the Corleone \n               Mall. EXTRA BUTTON MEN, as well as SOME POLICE, and PRIVATE \n               DETECTIVES.\n\n               It all seems to be under the supervision of ROCCO LAMPONE.\n\n\n\n               All is silent. The WOMEN and CHILDREN, dressed in Sunday \n               clothes, wait.\n\n               EXT. DAY: AMBULANCE (SPRING 1946)\n\n               One ambulance, speeding along the Grand Central Parkway, \n               preceded and followed by a dark car, each one carrying a \n               team of BUTTON MEN.\n\n               Sitting next to the DRIVER of the ambulance is a GUARD with \n               a rifle on his lap.\n\n               INT. DAY: DON'S HALL (SPRING 1946)\n\n               Inside the Main CORLEONE House:\n\n               Hospital ORDERLIES carry the DON on his stretcher carefully \n               under the watchful eyes of CLEMENZA, TESSIO, LAMPONE and \n               various GUARDS and BUTTON MEN.\n\n               All the CORLEONE family is here today: MAMA, FREDO, SANDRA, \n               THERESA, CONNIE, CARLO; the various CORLEONE CHILDREN.\n\n               INT. DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\n               The DON is made comfortable in his room, which has all but \n               been converted into a hospital room, with complete and \n               extensive equipment. The various CHILDREN get a turn to kiss \n               the OLD MAN, as he is made comfortable... and then SONNY \n               indicates that all the CHILDREN, WOMEN, and CARLO should \n               leave.\n\n               They do, the door is closed.\n\n               INT. DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\n               The mood is quite happy downstairs, as the WOMEN prepare the \n               Sunday dinner, and set the table.\n\n               CARLO sits alone among them, a frown on his face.\n\n                                     CONNIE\n                         What's the matter, Carlo?\n\n                                     CARLO\n                         Shut up.\n\n               INT. DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\n               All the MEN of the family stand around the hospital bed with \n               grim faces, SONNY and HAGEN closest to the OLD MAN. The DON \n               does not speak, yet he asks questions with his looks and \n               glances, as clearly as if they were verbalized. HAGEN is the \n               spokesman for the family.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         ...since McCluskey's killing, the \n                         police have cracked down on most of \n                         our operations... on the other \n                         families too.

Then he searches around the room \n               for a face he does not see. HAGEN knows who he's looking \n               for.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         Michael...\n                              (he takes a breath)\n                         It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.\n\n               The DON closes his eyes, and then reopens them in anger and \n               rage.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         He's safe now... we're already working \n                         on ways to bring him back.\n\n               The DON is very angry, he motions with a weak hand that they \n               leave him alone.\n\n               INT. DAY: DON'S STAIRS AND HALL (SPRING 1946)\n\n               HAGEN is very upset as he comes down the Stairs; SONNY is \n               expansive and optimistic.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         We'll let the old man take it easy \n                         for a couple of weeks.

DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\n               The FAMILY, WIVES, CHILDREN and all sit around the table \n               over Sunday dinner. SONNY is at the head of the table.\n\n               EXT. DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)\n\n               SOME of the CORLEONE GRANDCHILDREN play in the enclosed Mall, \n               in the proximity of the BUTTON MEN stationed liberally by \n               the gate.\n\n               ONE CHILD misses a ball, it rolls by the gate house. A young \n               BUTTON MAN scoops it up and throws it back, smiling.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               INT. DAY: CONNIE'S APT. (SPRING 1946)\n\n               CONNIE and CARLO's apartment. She's in a slip, on the phone.  \n               We HEAR the shower going in the bathroom.\n\n                                     CONNIE\n                         Who is this?\n\n                                     GIRL (O.S.)\n                              (giggle)\n                         I'm a friend of Carlo's. I just wanted \n                         to tell him I can't see him tonight; \n                         I have to go out of town.\n\n               CONNIE's face turns red.\n\n                                     CONNIE\n                         You lousy tramp bitch.\n                              (click)\n\n               She slams the phone down; just as CARLO is coming out of the \n               bathroom drying his golden body.\n\n                                     CARLO\n                         What was that?\n\n                                     CONNIE\n                         Your girl friend. She says she can't \n                         make it tonight. You lousy bastard \n                         you have the nerve to give your whores \n                         my telephone number. I'll kill you, \n                         you bastard!\n\n               She hauls off and punches him knowingly; he laughs, so then \n               she flings herself at him, kicking and scratching; her heavy \n               belly heaving under the thin slip.\n\n                                     CARLO\n                              (defending himself)\n                         You're crazy. She was kidding around; \n                         I don't know, some nut.\n\n               He pushes her aside, and moves into the bedroom to continue \n               dressing.\n\n                                     CONNIE\n                         You're staying home.

You gonna make me something \n                         to eat at least?\n\n               That calms her down; she stands there a moment, breathing \n               heavily; and then she nods, and goes into the kitchen, and \n               starts her wifely duties.\n\n               CARLO is dressed; puts on some cologne; CONNIE appears in \n               the doorway.\n\n                                     CONNIE\n                         The food is on the table.\n\n                                     CARLO\n                         I'm not hungry yet.\n\n                                     CONNIE\n                         Eat it, it's on the table.\n\n                                     CARLO\n                         Ba Fa Goulle.\n\n                                     CONNIE\n                         BA FA GOULE YOU!\n\n               She turns deliberately, goes out into the kitchen. A moment \n               later we begin to hear the sound of dishes breaking. CARLO \n               slowly walks out, where we can see CONNIE systematically \n               smashing all the dishes against the sink, sending the greasy \n               veal and peppers all over the apartment floor.\n\n                                     CARLO\n                         You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean \n                         it up or I'll kick your head in.\n\n                                     CONNIE\n                         Like hell I will.\n\n               She stands there, solid, ready to punch him again. Slowly, \n               he slides his belt out of his trousers, and doubles it in \n               his hand.\n\n                                     CARLO\n                         Clean it up!\n\n               He swings the belt against her heavy hips. She moves back \n               into the kitchen, and gets a kitchen knife, and holds it \n               ready.\n\n                                     CARLO\n                         Even the female Corleones are \n                         murderers.\n\n               He puts the strap down on a table, and moves after her. She \n               makes a sudden thrust at his groin, which he avoids. He pulls \n               the knife away, cutting his hand in the process. She gets \n               away momentarily, but he pursues her around the table, gets \n               her; and starts to slap her in the face.\n\n               She breaks away from him, and rushes into the bedroom.\n\n                                     CONNIE\n                         The baby! The baby!\n\n               INT. DAY: CONNIE'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\n\n\n               She runs into the bedroom; he follows. She moves into a \n               corner, and then like a desperate animal, tries to hide under \n               the bed.\n\n               He reaches under, and pulls her out by the hair.\n\n               He slaps her in the face until she begins to weep; then he \n               throws her on the bed, contemptuously. He grabs part of her \n               thigh, pinching it very hard.\n\n                                     CARLO\n                         You're fat as a pig.\n\n               Then he pushes her away, and walks out of the room, leaving \n               her in tears. She is crying; she pulls herself to the bedroom \n               phone, and in a whisper:\n\n                                     CONNIE\n                         Mama... mama, it's Connie. Mama, I \n                         can't talk any louder. No, I don't \n                         want to talk to Sonny.\n\n               We can tell that the phone has been passed to SONNY.\n\n               INT. DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (SPRING 1946)\n\n               In the kitchen at the Mall, MAMA cannot understand the \n               whispering and she has given the phone to SONNY.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Yeah Connie.\n\n                                     CONNIE (O.S.)\n                         Sonny, just send a car to bring me \n                         home. I'll tell you then, it's nothing \n                         Sonny, don't you come. Send TOM, \n                         please Sonny, it's nothing; I just \n                         want to come home.\n\n               SONNY's face is turning red.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                              (in a controlled voice)\n                         You wait there. You just wait there.\n\n               He hangs up the phone; and just stands there for a moment.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                              (quietly)\n                         That sonofabitch; that sonofabitch...\n\n               HAGEN enters the room; he knows what is happening, knows he \n               cannot interfere.\n\n               EXT. DAY: MALL\n\n               SONNY leaves the house. HAGEN moves to the outside mall just \n               as SONNY's car is driving off. He moves to a group of BUTTON \n               MEN.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         Go after him.\n\n               EXT. DAY: CAUSEWAY (SPRING 1946)\n\n               SONNY's car on the Jones Beach Causeway, speeds quickly by.  \n               After a pause, another car, with the CORLEONE BODYGUARDS, is \n               trailing.\n\n\n\n               SONNY is driving; he is very angry.\n\n               EXT. NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)\n\n               SONNY in his car; driving back. Still breathing hard and \n               still furious. Then he thinks it's funny; he enjoyed it.\n\n               He starts laughing, louder and louder, as he pulls up to a \n               toll booth, stops, and extends his hand with a coin to the \n               COLLECTOR.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               INT. NITE: AMERIGO BONASERA'S APARTMENT\n\n               The serious-faced UNDERTAKER is on the telephone.\n\n                                     HAGEN (O.S.)\n                         This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling for \n                         Don Corleone, at his request.\n\n               BONASERA looks at his WIFE, with deep anxiety in his eyes.  \n               BONASERA's lips are suddenly dry.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         Yes, I understand.

In one \n                         hour, not before, perhaps later, he \n                         will be at your funeral parlor to \n                         ask for your help.

His WIFE knows \n               something serious is happening, and never takes her eyes \n               from him. He lights a cigarette.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         For the last year, they have been \n                         killing one another. So now, what?\n                         Your Godfather comes to me... Why?\n                              (whispering, slyly)\n                         They've killed someone so important \n                         that they wish to make his body \n                         disappear.\n\n\n\n                                     MRS.

They could send me to \n                         jail!\n\n               He slips into his trousers. Then he moves to his WIFE to tie \n               his tie, as she has done for years.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         And if the other families find out... \n                         they will make me their enemy. They \n                         could come here to our house. I curse \n                         the day I ever went to the Godfather.\n\n               EXT. NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)\n\n               With his ring of keys, he opens the funeral parlor, enters.\n\n               INT. NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)\n\n               BONASERA walks through the darkened funeral parlor, without \n               turning on the lights; then into the rear, preparation room, \n               past the tables, and equipment. He operates the chain that \n               lifts a large overhead garage type door. And looks out into \n               the alley.\n\n               He sits on a bench, and waits.\n\n               EXT. NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR ALLEY (SPRING 1946)\n\n               The tires of a car roll very quietly along the small alley; \n               we notice a dark car approach the rear of BONASERA's funeral \n               parlor.\n\n               CLEMENZA gets out, and moves to the open, rear door. BONASERA \n               greets him, too petrified to speak. He notices TWO OTHER MEN \n               get out of the car, and carry a stretcher with a CORPSE \n               swaddled in a gray blanket, with yellowed feet protruding.\n\n               BONASERA closes his eyes in fear, but indicates which way \n               the MEN should carry their sinister burden.\n\n               INT. NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR EMBALMING ROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\n               They carry the CORPSE to one of the tables in the embalming \n               room.\n\n               Then BONASERA turns to see ANOTHER MAN step out of the \n               darkness somewhat uncertainly. It is DON CORLEONE.\n\n               He walks up to BONASERA, very close, without speaking. His \n               cold eyes looking directly at the frightened UNDERTAKER.\n\n               Then, after a long gaze:\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Well my friend, are you ready to do \n                         me this service?\n\n               BONASERA nods. The DON moves to the CORPSE on the embalming \n               table; he makes a gesture, and the OTHER MEN leave them alone.\n\n                                     BONASERA\n                         What do you wish me to do?\n\n\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                              (staring at the table)\n                         I want you to use all your powers, \n                         all your skill, as you love me. I do \n                         not want his mother to see him as he \n                         is.\n\n               He draws down the gray blanket.\n\n               BONASERA lets out a gasp of horror at what he sees:\n\n               The bullet-smashed face of SONNY CORLEONE.\n\n               EXT. NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)\n\n               SONNY extends his hand with a coin at the toll booth.\n\n               A car suddenly swerves in front of him, trapping him in the \n               booth, and in incredible rally of machine gun fire greets \n               him, coming through and smashing the windows of the toll \n               booths on both side of him, and from the front window of the \n               car blocking him.\n\n               The windows of his car are shot out.\n\n               Bullet holes puncture the doors of his car.\n\n               His hand, with the coin in it, falls inside the car.\n\n               His arms, shoulders are riddled by the fire, and still it \n               continues, as though the ASSASSINS cannot take a chance that \n               he will survive it.\n\n               Suddenly, he lets out an enormous ROAR, like a bull, and \n               actually, opens the door, and steps out of the car, UNDER \n               fire.\n\n               His face is hit; and finally he falls to the ground.\n\n               A FULL SHOT... as the ASSASSINS scramble for their cars and \n               make off in the distance.\n\n               SONNY's BODYGUARDS stop a safe distance away, realizing they \n               are too late.\n\n               INT. NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\n               View on HAGEN's ashen face in the living room. He is silent \n               a moment, and then:\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                              (quietly)\n                         OK. Go to Clemenza's house and tell \n                         him to come here right away. He'll \n                         tell you what to do.\n\n               The MEN leave him alone. He is quiet, standing in the middle \n               of the living room a moment. He looks in the direction of \n               the kitchen, where he can see fragments of MAMA moving around.\n\n               INT. NITE: UPSTAIRS (SPRING 1946)\n\n               TOM proceeds up stairs, and quietly in the direction of the \n               DON's room. He opens the DON's door. Looks in.\n\n               INT. NITE: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\n               The DON in his hospital bed. Asleep under sedation. HAGEN \n\n\n\n               hesitates. He cannot go in; he cannot tell the OLD MAN. He \n               closes the door.\n\n               INT. NITE: DON'S OFFICE (SPRING 1946)\n\n               HAGEN alone in the office. He is drinking. He looks up at \n               the sound of cars; the CAPOREGIMES are arriving. Then he \n               hears footsteps.\n\n               The door opens; and in a robe, with slippers, DON CORLEONE \n               slowly enters the room. He walks directly to his stuffed \n               armchair, sits down. His face is stern, as he looks into \n               HAGEN's eyes.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Give me a drop of anisette.\n\n               HAGEN rises, and pours a glass for the OLD MAN.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         My wife was weeping before she fell \n                         asleep, outside my window I saw my \n                         caporegimes to the house, and it is \n                         midnight. So, Consigliere of mine, I \n                         think you should tell your Don what \n                         everyone knows.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                              (quietly)\n                         I didn't tell Mama anything. I was \n                         about to come up and wake you and \n                         tell you. Just now.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         But you needed a drink first.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         Yes.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Now you've had your drink.\n\n               Pause.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         They shot Sonny on the Causeway.\n                              (pause)\n                         He's dead.\n\n               DON CORLEONE blinks. One feels that just for a second he \n               loses all physical strength; he clasps his hands in front of \n               him on the top of the desk and looks into HAGEN's eyes.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         I want no inquiries made. No acts of \n                         vengeance.\n                              (pause)\n                         Consigliere, arrange a meeting with \n                         the heads of the five families... \n                         this war stops now.\n\n               He rises and unsteadily leaves the room, turns...\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Call Bonasera... he will do me a \n                         service.\n\n               And leaves. HAGEN moves to the phone; dials...\n\n\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for \n                         Don Corleone, at his request.\n\n                                     BONASERA (O.S.)\n                         Yes, I understand I'm listening.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         You owe the Don a service. He has no \n                         doubt that you will repay it.\n\n               EXT. DAY: BANK BUILDING (SPRING 1946)\n\n               Day in Manhattan. An impressive Bank Building in the financial \n               center of New York. Many limousines are parked, uniforms and \n               plain-clothed CHAUFFEURS waiting quietly.\n\n               INT. DAY: BOARD ROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\n               The Board Room of a bank, daylight shines in the windows.\n\n               CARLO TRAMONTI, an impressive, handsome middle-aged man, \n               sits quietly, smoking a Di Napoli cigar, OUR VIEW moves to a \n               MAN sitting to his left, and a little to the rear, and settles \n               on JOSEPH ZALUCHI, a moon-faced amiable-looking man; as the \n               view continues, around the table, we HEAR:\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE (O.S.)\n                         I want to thank you all for coming.\n                         I consider it a service done to me \n                         personally and I am in the debt of \n                         each and every one of you. Especially \n                         those of you who have traveled from \n                         such distances as California, St. \n                         Louis, Kansas City; and New Orleans...\n\n               The VIEW PASSES to FRANK FALCONE and ANTHONY MOLINARI, both \n               younger than any of the others; then on to DOMENICK PANZA, \n               short and squat sitting in a wheelchair; then around the \n               table to DON VINCENENZO FORLENZA, who is whispering to his \n               JEWISH ASSISTANT; the VIEW PASSES on to ANTHONY STRACCI, an \n               older man, sipping from a drink and smoking a cigar; OTTILIO \n               CUNEO, in his middle sixties with a jolly round face; then \n               DON PHILLIP TATTAGLIA, a delicate older man with dyed hair \n               and a pencil mustache; and finally, EMILIO BARZINI, in his \n               early sixties, a man to 'respect'; whom we had seen at \n               CONNIE's Wedding.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Ah well, let's get down to business.\n                         We are all honorable men here, we \n                         don't have to give assurances as if \n                         we were lawyers.\n                              (he sits, gazes out \n                              at them, and sighs)\n                         How did things ever go so far? Well, \n                         no matter. A lot of foolishness has \n                         come to pass. It was so unfortunate, \n                         so unnecessary.\n\n               The VIEW examines the room once again, as the DON speaks. A \n               large, clicking board is changing numbers at various times, \n               and two tapes, showing the fluctuations of the Market during \n               the day's trading, and projected above.\n\n               DON CORLEONE pauses; and TOM HAGEN hands him a cold drink.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Tattaglia has lost a son; I have \n\n\n\n                         lost a son. We are quits. Let there \n                         be a peace...\n                              (he gestures \n                              expressively, \n                              submissively, with \n                              his hands)\n                         That is all I want...\n\n                                     BARZINI\n                         Don Corleone is too modest. He had \n                         the judges and politicians in his \n                         pocket and he refused to share them.\n                         His refusal is not the act of a \n                         friend. He takes the bread out of \n                         the mouths of our families. Times \n                         have changed, it's not like the old \n                         days where everyone can go his own \n                         way. If Don Corleone had all the \n                         judges and politicians in New York, \n                         then he must share them or let others \n                         use them. Certainly he can present a \n                         bill for such services, we're not \n                         Communists, after all. But he has to \n                         let us draw water from the well. \n                         It's that simple.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         My friends, I didn't refuse out of \n                         malice. You all know me. When have I \n                         ever refused an accommodation? But \n                         why, this time? Because I think this \n                         drug business will destroy us in the \n                         years to come. It's not like whiskey \n                         or gambling or even women which most \n                         people want and is forbidden them by \n                         the pezzonovante of the Church and \n                         the Government. But drugs? No. Even \n                         policemen, who help us in gambling \n                         and other things would refuse to \n                         help us in drugs. But... I am willing \n                         to do whatever all of you think is \n                         necessary.\n\n                                     DON ZALUCHI\n                         I don't believe in drugs. For years \n                         I paid my people extra so they \n                         wouldn't do that kind of business... \n                         $200 a week. But it didn't matter.  \n                         Somebody comes to them and says, \"I \n                         have powders, if you put up three, \n                         four thousand dollar investment, we \n                         can make fifty thousand distributing.\"  \n                         Who can resist such a profit? There's \n                         no way to control it, as a business... \n                         to keep it respectable.\n                              (rapping the table)\n                         I don't want it near schools! I don't \n                         want it sold to children. That is an \n                         infamita.\n                              (thinking)\n                         In my city I would try to keep the \n                         traffic in the dark people, the \n                         colored. They are the best customers, \n                         the least troublesome, and they are \n                         animals anyway. They have no respect \n                         for their wives or their families or \n                         themselves. Let them lose their souls \n                         with drugs. But something has to be \n                         done, we can't have everybody running \n\n\n\n                         around doing just what they please, \n                         like a bunch of anarchists.\n\n                                     BARZINI\n                         Then, are we agreed; the traffic in \n                         drugs will be permitted, but \n                         controlled; and Don Corleone agrees \n                         to give it protection in the East.\n\n               DON CORLEONE nods.\n\n                                     BARZINI\n                         That's the whole matter then, we \n                         have the peace, and let me pay my \n                         respects to Don Corleone, whom we \n                         have all known over the years as a \n                         man of his word.\n                              (noticing TATTAGLIA \n                              is uneasy)\n                         Don Philip?\n\n                                     TATTAGLIA\n                         I agree to everything here, I'm \n                         willing to forget my own misfortune.\n                         But I must hear strict assurance \n                         from Corleone. When time goes by and \n                         his position becomes stronger, will \n                         he attempt any individual vengeance?\n\n               They all look at the DON; especially HAGEN, who feels that \n               DON CORLEONE has given a great deal, and must have something \n               else in mind. Slowly the DON rises.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         I forego my vengeance for my dead \n                         son, for the common good. But I have \n                         selfish reasons. My youngest son had \n                         to flee, accused of Sollozzo's murder, \n                         and I must now make arrangements so \n                         that he can come home with safety, \n                         cleared of all those false charges.  \n                         That is my affair, and I will make \n                         those arrangements.\n                              (with strength)\n                         But I am a superstitious man... and \n                         so if some unlucky accident should \n                         befall my youngest son, if some police \n                         officer should accidentally shoot \n                         him, or if he should hang himself in \n                         his cell, or if my son is struck by \n                         a bolt of lightning, then I will \n                         blame some of the people here. That, \n                         I could never forgive, but... aside \n                         from that, let me swear by the souls \n                         of my Grandchildren that I will never \n                         be the one to break the peace we \n                         have made.\n\n               EXT. NITE: DON'S LIMO (SPRING 1946)\n\n               The DON's black limousine. He sits quietly in the padded \n               rear seat; TOM HAGEN next to him.\n\n               It is night.

No, it was \n                         Barzini all along.\n\n               The black limousine speeds away from us in the night.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               EXT DAY: ESTABLISHING SICILY SHOT\n\n               A CLOSE VIEW OF MICHAEL, moving as he walks, sullen and \n               downcast, the left side of his face healed, but left grotesque \n               and misshapen.\n\n               GRADUALLY, THE VIEW LOOSENS, he wears a warm navy Pea jacket, \n               and walks with his hands in his pockets.\n\n               THE VIEW LOOSENS FURTHER, revealing a Sicilian SHEPHERD on \n               either side of him, each carrying a shotgun slung over his \n               shoulder, CALO, a squat and husky young man with a simple \n               honest quality, and FABRIZZIO, slender and handsome, likable, \n               and with a pleasing build. Each of the SHEPHERDS carry \n               knapsacks.\n\n               The THREE YOUNG MEN continue over the Sicilian landscape, \n               overlooking an impressive view of land and sea.\n\n               EXT. DAY: SICILY ROAD\n\n               The THREE move through a flock of wind-blown sheep, and make \n               their way to a dusty rural road. We HEAR a rinky horn sound, \n               as a pre-war Italian automobile makes its way to them. An \n               OLD MAN peeks from the window, waving to MICHAEL. The car \n               pulls in front of them and stops. MICHAEL nods respectfully.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Don Tommassino.\n\n                                     DON TOMMASSINO\n                         Michael, why must you do this.

DAY: COUNTRYSIDE\n\n               The THREE pass through abundant areas of flowers and fruit \n               trees, in bloom and bursting with life.\n\n               EXT. DAY: VILLAGE\n\n               They continue in the empty streets of a little town; the \n               post-war poverty is evident in the skinny dogs; and the empty \n               streets. Occasionally, a military vehicle, the only gasoline-\n               powered vehicles on the road, will pass. And there are many \n               POLICE evident, most of them carrying machine guns.\n\n               The THREE pass under an enormous banner slung over the main \n               road \"VOTA COMMUNISTA\".\n\n\n\n               EXT. DAY: COUNTRY ROAD\n\n               They continue through dusty country roads, where occasionally \n               a donkey pulling a cart, or a lone horseman will pass them.\n\n               EXT. DAY: FIELD\n\n               Out in a field, in the distance, they come upon a procession \n               of peasants and activists, perhaps two hundred strong, \n               marching, and singing, and in the lead, are five or six men \n               carrying billowing red banners.\n\n               EXT. DAY: GROVE\n\n               They are in an orange grove; on the other side of the trees \n               is a deep, tall field of wild flowers.\n\n               The Shepherds unsling their guns and knapsacks, and take out \n               loaves of bread, some wine, sausage and cheese.\n\n               MICHAEL rests against a tree, and uses his handkerchief.\n\n                                     FABRIZZIO\n                         You tell us about America.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         How do you know I come from America?\n\n                                     FABRIZZIO\n                         We hear.

DAY: ANOTHER ROAD\n\n               The TRIO continues down a dirt road, as an American Military \n               convoy speeds by; FABRIZZIO waves, and calls out to each of \n               the U.S. drivers, as they move by.\n\n                                     FABRIZZIO\n                         America.

DAY: CORLEONE HILL\n\n               They continue their long hike, high on a promontory; until \n               they hesitate, and look down.\n\n                                     CALO\n\n\n\n                         Corleone.\n\n               They can see a grim Sicilian village, almost devoid of people.\n\n               EXT. DAY: CORLEONE STREET\n\n               MICHAEL and his bodyguards move through the empty streets of \n               the village. They walk behind him, and spread to either side \n               about fifteen feet away from him.\n\n               They move down ancient steps, past an old stone fountain.  \n               MICHAEL hesitates, cups his hands and drinks some water.\n\n               They go on.\n\n               They move up a very narrow old street. MICHAEL looks at the \n               doorways that they pass.\n\n               MOVING VIEW: Each door has a plaque, with a ribbon or flower.\n\n               CALO sees MICHAEL looking.\n\n                                     CALO\n                         The names of the dead.\n\n               MICHAEL hesitates in the center of the main street. He looks.\n\n               The street is empty, barren. Occasionally, an old woman will \n               pass.\n\n               MICHAEL turns his head.\n\n               The other side of the street: empty and deathly.\n\n               A HIGH VIEW of MICHAEL standing in the center of the old \n               street, the shepherds a respectful distance away.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               EXT. DAY: BARONIAL ESTATE\n\n               A green ribboned field of a baronial Estate. Further ahead \n               is a villa so Roman it looks as though it had just been \n               discovered in the ruins of Pompeii. There is a group of young \n               village GIRLS accompanied by two stocky MATRONS, dressed in \n               black. They have been gathering the pink sulla, purple \n               wisteria, and mixing them with orange and lemon blossoms. \n               They are singing, off in the distance as they work.\n\n               MICHAEL, CALO and FABRIZZIO are silent as they watch this \n               Fantasy-like scene.\n\n                                     FABRIZZIO\n                              (calling out to them)\n                         Hey, beautiful girls!\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                              (sternly)\n                         Shhhhh.\n\n               He settles down to watch.\n\n               The GIRLS are dressed in cheap gaily painted frocks that \n               cling to their bodies. They are still in their teens, but \n               developed and womanly.\n\n               They are moving along the fields, picking blossoms, not aware \n               of the three men watching them from the orange grove.\n\n\n\n               Three or four of the girls begin chasing one of them \n               playfully, in the direction of the grove.\n\n               The GIRL being chased holds a bunch of purple grapes in her \n               left hand and with the right, picks more grapes, and throws \n               them back at her pursuers laughing.\n\n               They come closer and closer. Just short of the grove, she \n               poses, startled, her large, oval shaped eyes catching the \n               view of the THREE MEN. She stands there on her toes about to \n               run.\n\n               MICHAEL sees her; now face to face. He looks.\n\n               Her face. Incredibly beautiful with olive skin, black hair \n               and a rich mouth.\n\n                                     FABRIZZIO\n                              (murmuring)\n                         Jesus Christ, take my soul. I'm dying.\n\n               Quickly, she turns, and runs away.\n\n               MICHAEL stands up never taking his eyes from her. We hold on \n               him for a long while; and eventually hear the SHEPHERDS \n               laughing. Then he turns to them.\n\n                                     FABRIZZIO\n                         You got hit by the thunderbolt, eh?\n\n               CALO pats him on the shoulder.\n\n                                     CALO\n                         Easy man.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         What are you talking about?\n\n                                     FABRIZZIO\n                         You can't hide it when you're hit by \n                         the thunderbolt.\n\n               EXT. DAY: BARONIAL VILLAGE\n\n               The little village built attendant to the Baronial Estate, \n               is decked with the flowers the girls had been picking.\n\n               MICHAEL, followed by the bodyguards, moves into the central \n               square, and onto the balcony of a little cafe.\n\n               The proprietor of the cafe, VITELLI, is a short burly man; \n               he greets them cheerfully, and sets a dish of chickpeas at \n               their table.\n\n                                     FABRIZZIO\n                         You know all the girls in this town, \n                         eh? We saw some beauties coming down \n                         the road.

Right, Calo?\n\n                                     VITELLI\n                              (laughing)\n                         Beautiful all over, eh?\n\n                                     FABRIZZIO\n                         And hair. Black and curly, like a \n                         doll. And such a mouth.\n\n               VITELLI does not laugh quite so much.\n\n                                     VITELLI\n                         Yes, we have beautiful girls here... \n                         but virtuous.\n\n               VITELLI is no longer drinking with them.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         She wore a red dress, and a red ribbon \n                         in her hair. She looks more Greek \n                         than Italian. Do you know a beauty \n                         like that?\n\n               As MICHAEL describes her, VITELLI laughed less and less, \n               until he wears a scowl.\n\n                                     VITELLI\n                         No.\n\n               Then he curtly leaves him, and walks into the back room.\n\n                                     FABRIZZIO\n                         God in Heaven, I think I understand...\n\n               He goes into the back room after the innkeeper.

It's \n                         his daughter.\n\n               They start to leave; but MICHAEL doesn't move.\n\n                                     CALO\n                         Come quickly.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Innkeeper.

DAY: VILLA COURTYARD\n\n               Morning.

DAY: VILLA COURTYARD\n\n               There is the car, with APPOLONIA sitting in the driver's \n               seat, playing with the wheel like a child.\n\n               CALO moves to the car, and puts a lunch basket in the rear \n               seat.\n\n               Then MICHAEL seems disturbed.\n\n               Over, on the other side of the courtyard, he sees FABRIZZIO \n               disappear through the gate.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                              (muttering to himself)\n                         Where the hell is he going?\n\n               MICHAEL goes down the hallway, and outside.\n\n               MICHAEL steps out into the bright sunlight of the outer \n               courtyard, causing him to shade his eyes.\n\n               APPOLONIA sees him, and waves, motioning that he should stay \n               where he is.\n\n                                     APPOLONIA\n                              (calling out)\n                         I'll drive to you.\n\n               He smiles affectionately.\n\n               CALO stands beside the car, smiling, with his lupara dangling \n               by his side. There is no sight of FABRIZZIO. Suddenly the \n               smile fades from MICHAEL's face. He steps forward and holds \n               out his hand.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         No. No!\n\n\n\n               His shout is drowned in the roar of a tremendous EXPLOSION, \n               as she switched on the ignition.\n\n               Part of the wall is caved in, the kitchen door is blown off; \n               and there is nothing left of the Alpha, or of Appolonia.\n\n               MICHAEL is thrown against the wall, and knocked unconscious.\n\n               INT. DAY: VILLA BEDROOM\n\n               MICHAEL is unconscious in a darkened room. We hear whispering \n               around him, but can't make any of it out. A soft cloth is \n               applied to his face; gradually his eyes open. DON TOMMASSINO \n               is there, close to him. He looks at them and from their grave \n               expressions, he knows his wife is dead.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Fabrizzio.

DAY: MALL (SPRING 1951)\n\n               Easter.\n\n               A HIGH VIEW ON THE CORLEONE MALL in the springtime. Hordes \n               of little CHILDREN including many of the Corleone Children \n               and Grandchilren, rush about carrying little Easter baskets, \n               searching here and there for candy treasures and hidden Easter \n               eggs.\n\n               The DON himself, much older, much smaller in size, wearing \n               baggy pants and a plaid shirt and an old hat, moves around \n               his garden, tending rows and rows of rich tomato plants.\n\n               Suddenly, he stops and looks.\n\n               MICHAEL stands there, still holding his suitcase.\n\n               Great emotion comes over the DON, who takes a few steps in \n               MICHAEL's direction.\n\n               MICHAEL leaves his suitcase and walks to his favorite son \n               and embraces him.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Be my son...\n\n               INT.

DAY: FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE (1955)\n\n               A whole entourage precedes FREDO and his V.I.P. party of \n               MICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI. Great fuss is made. They are being \n               shown into the hotel's 'special' suite.\n\n                                     FREDO\n                         You look wonderful, kid; really \n                         wonderful.

NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE BEDROOM (1955)\n\n               MICHAEL is alone in the bedroom. He is just finishing \n               dressing; he puts on his jacket. From the window, with the \n               lights blinking, we can tell it's late at night. MICHAEL \n               passes into the other room.\n\n               He stops, looks. He is disturbed.\n\n               INT. NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955)\n\n               A magnificent, circular table has been set up in his suite; \n               a lavish table setting for eight. Standing by the table are \n               HAGEN, JOHNNY FONTANE, looking wonderful, a little heavier, \n               beautifully dressed; FREDO, a dandy, and TWO LAS VEGAS GIRLS.  \n               NERI stands quietly by the door.\n\n                                     FREDO\n                         Mike!

NERI opens the door, and MOE GREENE enters, followed \n               by TWO BODYGUARDS. He is a handsome hood, dressed in the \n               Hollywood style.

They argue in gambling \n                         games; they jump out of their cars \n                         in a rage if someone so much as \n                         scratches their fender. These people \n                         wander through the streets calling \n                         out \"Kill me, kill me.\" Luca Brasi \n                         was like that. And since he wasn't \n                         scared of death, and in fact, looked \n                         for it... I made him my weapon. \n                         Because I was the only person in the \n                         world that he truly hoped would not \n                         kill him. I think you have done the \n                         same with this man.\n\n               They walk through the DON's vegetable garden. Tomatoes, \n               peppers, carefully tended, and covered with a silky netting.  \n               MICHAEL follows; the DON turns and looks at him. Then stoops \n               over to right a tomato plant that had been pushed over.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Barzini will move against you first.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         How?\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         He will get in touch with you through \n                         someone you absolutely trust. That \n                         person will arrange a meeting, \n                         guarantee your safety...\n\n               He rises, and looks at Michael...\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         ...and at that meeting you will be \n                         assassinated.\n\n               The DON walks on further.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Your wife and children... you're \n\n\n\n                         happy with them?\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Yes.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         Good.\n\n               MICHAEL wants to express something... hesitates, then:\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         I've always respected you...\n\n               A long silence. The DON smiles at MICHAEL.\n\n                                     DON CORLEONE\n                         And I... you.\n\n               EXT. DAY: CHURCH (1955)\n\n               KAY and MAMA walking from the black car that has just left \n               them off.\n\n                                     KAY\n                         How is your husband feeling?\n\n                                     MAMA\n                         He's not the same since they shot \n                         him. He lets Michael do all the work. \n                         He just plays the fool with his \n                         garden, his peppers, his tomatoes, \n                         as if he was some peasant still.  \n                         But men are like that...\n\n               She stops toward the Church.\n\n                                     MAMA\n                         You come in, too.\n\n               KAY shakes her head.\n\n                                     MAMA\n                         The Priest ain't gonna bite you cause \n                         you're not Catholic.\n                              (whispered)\n                         He's in the back drinkin' his wine.\n\n               KAY laughs and follows MAMA up the steps of the Church.  \n               They enter.\n\n               INT. DAY: CHURCH (1955)\n\n               Inside the Church, KAY watches as MAMA blesses herself from \n               the holy water.\n\n                                     MAMA\n                         You can.\n\n               Tentatively, KAY dips her fingers into the water, and blesses \n               herself. Then SHE follows MAMA down the aisle, in awe at the \n               high ceiling, the art, the windows, and finally the Altar.\n\n               MAMA stops by the impressive tiers of candles. There is a \n               large coin box for those who wish to pay for lighting candles.  \n               MAMA fumbles in her purse for change; KAY gives her some.\n\n               MAMA drops the coins in the box, one by one; then takes the \n               taper, and in a pattern known only to her, and with great \n               dignity, she closes her eyes, says a prayer, and then lights \n\n\n\n               twenty candles.\n\n               She finishes, and bows her head.\n\n               EXT. DAY: BONASERA'S FUNERAL HOME\n\n               Very few people in the streets. TOTAL SILENCE. But black \n               flower cars as far as the eye can see, for blocks and blocks.\n\n               An expression of respect, of honor and fear that is enormous.\n\n               Certainly no more could be done for a President or a King.\n\n               Each car carries an elaborate floral decoration. We show \n               these in detail; and the flowered messages: \"A Benefactor to \n               Mankind\", \"He Knew and Pitied\"... \"Our Don Our Leader\"... \n               \"The Sacred Heart\"...\n\n               EXT. DAY: MALL (1955)\n\n               HIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL\n\n               Silence.\n\n               The flower cars, funeral limousines, and private cars fill \n               all the areas attendant to the Corleone residence.\n\n               Hundreds of people fill the Mall, reminiscent in size of the \n               wedding of Connie and Carlo; of course, now the mood is somber \n               and respectful.\n\n               MICHAEL, MAMA, FREDO and HAGEN stand by the flowered platform \n               which holds the ornate coffin. We cannot see the remains of \n               Don Corleone.\n\n               BONASERA is nearby, ready to do service to the bereaved \n               family. One by one the mourners come by, weeping, or merely \n               with grave expressions; pay their respects and continue on.\n\n               The VIEW ALTERS, and we see that the line is endless. JOHNNY \n               FONTANE, tears openly falling, takes his turn.\n\n               Children are taken by the hand, and lifted for their last \n               look at the great man.\n\n               CLEMENZA whispers into the ear of LAMPONE. LAMPONE immediately \n               arranges for the members of the Five New York Families to \n               pay their respects.\n\n               First CUNEO, then STRACHI and then ZALUCHI. Then PHILIP \n               TATTAGLIA, who merely passes by the Coffin.\n\n               Then BARZINI in a black homburg, standing a long time.\n\n               MICHAEL watches the scene.\n\n               BARZINI crosses himself and passes on, immediately rejoined \n               by his men.\n\n               As BARZINI leaves, it seems as though everyone is fawning on \n               him; perhaps asking for favors: But at any rate, it is clear \n               from the doors opened for him, the cigars lit for him, that \n               he is the new Capo di Capi--the place formerly held by Don \n               Corleone.\n\n               MICHAEL watches silently.\n\n               BARZINI is searching for somebody with his eyes. First \n               CLEMENZA. Then TESSIO.\n\n\n\n               CONNIE rushes into MICHAEL's arms, tears in her eyes. He \n               embraces and comforts her.\n\n               Everywhere MICHAEL goes, NERI is a few feet away--watching \n               all who come close to him.\n\n               EXT. DAY: MALL (LATER)\n\n               Later on the Mall; some people have left, although there are \n               still hundreds of mourners.\n\n               A young GIRL approaches TESSIO. She's about 18.\n\n                                     GIRL\n                         Do you remember me?\n\n                                     TESSIO\n                         No...\n\n                                     GIRL\n                         We danced together at Connie's \n                         wedding.\n\n               TESSIO makes a gesture, which is to say 'How you've grown', \n               and they move though the crowd, looking for Michael. He finds \n               him.\n\n                                     TESSIO\n                         Mike, could I have a minute?\n\n               MIKE; nods; and they move to a private place. NERI is close \n               by.\n\n                                     TESSIO\n                         Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.\n                         Says we can straighten any of our \n                         problems out.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         He talked to you?\n\n                                     TESSIO\n                              (nods)\n                         I can arrange security.\n\n               MICHAEL looks at him.\n\n               EXT.

He opens it, and we \n               see in it, nearly folded, a New York City Policeman's uniform.  \n               He takes it out piece by piece, almost reverently. Then the \n               badge, and the identification card; with his picture on it.  \n               Slowly, in the solitude of his room, he begins to dress.\n\n               INT. DAY: MICHAEL'S BEDROOM (1955)\n\n               MICHAEL and KAY are getting dressed for the christening in \n               their room.

DAY: MOTEL ROOM (1955)\n\n               In a Long Island motel.\n\n               ROCCO LAMPONE carefully disassembles a revolver; oils it, \n               checks it, and puts it back together.\n\n               EXT. DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (1955)\n\n               PETER CLEMENZA about to get in his Lincoln. He hesitates, \n               takes a rag and cleans some dirt off of the fender, and then \n               gets in, drives off.\n\n\n\n               EXT. DAY: CHURCH (1955)\n\n               The Church.\n\n               Various relatives and friends are beginning to gather at the \n               Church. They laugh and talk. A MONSIGNOR is officiating.\n\n               Not all of the participants have arrived yet.\n\n               CONNIE is there, with a beaming CARLO.

DAY: FIFTH AVE.\n\n               NERI continues up the 55th St. and Fifth Avenue area. He \n               continues until he is in front of Rockefeller Center. On his \n               side of the street, he spots a limousine waiting directly \n               across from the main entrance of the building. Slowly he \n               approaches the limo, and taps on its fender with his \n               nightstick.\n\n               The DRIVER looks up in surprise.\n\n               NERI points to the \"No Parking\" sign.\n\n               The DRIVER turns his head away.\n\n                                     NERI\n                         OK, wise guy, you wanna summons, or \n                         you wanna move?\n\n                                     DRIVER\n                              (obviously a hood)\n                         You better check with your precinct.\n\n                                     NERI\n                         Move it!\n\n               The DRIVER takes a ten dollar bill, folds it deliberately, \n\n\n\n               and hands it out the window, trying to put it under NERI's \n               jacket.\n\n               NERI backs up, letting the bill fall onto the street. Then \n               he crooks a finger at the DRIVER.\n\n                                     NERI\n                         Let me see you license and \n                         registration.\n\n               EXT. DAY: MOTEL BALCONY\n\n               LAMPONE on the motel balcony spots a Cadillac pulling up.\n\n               It parks. A young, pretty GIRL gets out. Quickly, he returns \n               into the room.\n\n               INT. DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955)\n\n               CLEMENZA is climbing the back stairs of a large hotel. He \n               rounds the corner, puffs a little, and then continues upward.\n\n               INT. DAY: CHURCH\n\n               The Church. Close on the PRIEST's fingers as he gently applies \n               oil to the infant's ears and nostrils.\n\n                                     PRIEST\n                         Ephetha... be opened...

DAY: ROCKEFELLER CENTER (1955)\n\n               The DRIVER of the limousine in front of Rockefeller Center \n               is arguing with NERI.\n\n               Now the DRIVER looks up.\n\n               WHAT HE SEES:\n\n               TWO MEN in topcoats exit the building, through the revolving \n               glass doors.\n\n               NERI opens up fire, trapping BARZINI in the shattering glass \n               doors. The doors still rotate, moving the dead body of BARZINI \n               within them.\n\n               INT. DAY: CHURCH\n\n               In the Church--the VIEW on MICHAEL. The PRIEST hands him the \n               infant.\n\n                                     PRIEST\n                         Do you renounce Satan.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         I do renounce him.\n\n                                     PRIEST\n                         And all his works?\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         I do renounce them.\n\n               INT. DAY: MOTEL MURDER (1955)\n\n               LAMPONE, backed up by two other MEN in his regime, runs down \n               the iron-rail steps, and kicks in the door on Room 7F. PHILIP \n\n\n\n               TATTAGLIA, old and wizened and naked, leaps up; a semi-nude \n               young GIRL leans up.\n\n               They are riddled with gunfire.\n\n               INT. DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955)\n\n               CLEMENZA, huffing and puffing, climbs the back stairs, with \n               his package.\n\n               INT. DAY: CHURCH\n\n               The PRIEST pours water over the forehead of the infant MICHAEL \n               holds.\n\n                                     PRIEST\n                         Do you wish to be baptized?\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         I do wish to be baptized.\n\n               INT. DAY: HOTEL ELEVATOR MURDER (1955)\n\n               CLEMENZA, out of breath, climbs the final few steps.\n\n               He walks through some glass doors, and moves to an ornate \n               elevator waiting shaft.\n\n               The lights indicate the elevator has arrived.\n\n               The doors open, and we see a surprised CUNEO standing with \n               the dapper MOE GREENE.\n\n               CLEMENZA fires into the small elevator with a shotgun.\n\n               The PRIEST hands a lighted candle to MICHAEL.\n\n                                     PRIEST\n                         I christen you Michael Francis Rizzi.\n\n               Flash bulbs go off. Everyone is smiles, and crowds around \n               MICHAEL, KAY, CONNIE... and CARLO.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               EXT. DAY: CHURCH (1955)\n\n               The christening party outside the Church.\n\n               Four or five limousines have been waiting; now pull up to \n               receive MAMA, CONNIE and the baby; and the others.\n\n               Everyone is very happy; only MICHAEL seems aloof and grave.\n\n               As the fuss is going on, a car pulls up. LAMPONE gets out \n               and works his way to MICHAEL. He whispers in his ear. This \n               is the news MICHAEL has been waiting for.\n\n               CONNIE holds the baby up to MICHAEL.\n\n                                     CONNIE\n                         Kiss your Godfather.\n\n               The infant turns its head, and MICHAEL uses that as an excuse \n               to back away.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         Carlo... we've had a change in the \n                         plans.

DAY: DON'S KITCHEN\n\n               TESSIO sits in the Kitchen of the Main House on the Mall.\n\n               HAGEN enters.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                         You'd better make your call to \n                         Barzini; Michael's ready.\n\n               TESSIO nods; moves to the telephone and dials a number.\n\n                                     TESSIO\n                         We're on our way to Brooklyn.\n\n               He hangs up and smiles.\n\n                                     TESSIO\n                         I hope Mike can get us a good deal \n                         tonight.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                              (gravely)\n                         I'm sure he will.\n\n               EXT. DAY: MALL (1955)\n\n               The TWO MEN walk out onto the Mall, toward a car. On their \n               way they are stopped by TWO BODYGUARDS.\n\n                                     BUTTON MAN\n                         The boss says he'll come in a separate \n                         car. He says for you two to go on \n                         ahead.\n\n                                     TESSIO\n                              (frowning)\n                         Hell, he can't do that. It screws up \n                         all my arrangements.\n\n               THREE MORE BODYGUARDS appear around him.\n\n                                     HAGEN\n                              (gently)\n                         I can't go with you either, Tessio.\n\n\n\n               He flashes at the men surrounding him; for a moment he panics, \n               and then he accepts it.\n\n                                     TESSIO\n                              (after the pause)\n                         Tell Mike it was business...

Then about twenty \n               paces away, he stops, and looks back.\n\n               TESSIO is led into a waiting car.\n\n               HAGEN looks away, and walks off.\n\n               INT. DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)\n\n               CARLO RIZZI is alone in his house, smoking, waiting rather \n               nervously. He moves to the window and looks out.\n\n               WHAT HE SEES:\n\n               EXT. DAY: MALL (1955)\n\n               MICHAEL, still dressed in a dark suit; followed by NERI, \n               LAMPONE and CLEMENZA, then HAGEN.\n\n               They move toward us.\n\n               Excitedly, CARLO moves to the front door; opens it.\n\n               He wears a broad smile.\n\n                                     CARLO\n                         Godfather!\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         You have to answer for Santino.\n\n               The smile on CARLO's face slowly fades, then, in a foolish \n               attempt for safety, he slams the door in their faces and \n               backs into the living room.\n\n               INT. DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)\n\n               The door opens, and the grim party enters.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                         You fingered Sonny for the Barzini \n                         people. That little farce you played \n                         out with my sister. Did Barzini kid \n                         you that would fool a Corleone?\n\n                                     CARLO\n                              (dignity)\n\n\n\n                         I swear I'm innocent.

After all, I'm Godfather \n                         to your son. No, your punishment is \n                         that you're out of the family \n                         business. I'm putting you on a plane \n                         to Vegas--and I want you to stay \n                         there. I'll send Connie an allowance, \n                         that's all. But don't keep saying \n                         you're innocent; it insults my \n                         intelligence and makes me angry.

He chokes and leaps \n               up like a fish on a line, kicking his feet.\n\n\n\n               The garrote is pulled tighter; CARLO's face turns color.\n\n               His thrashing feet kick right through the front windshield.\n\n               Then the body goes slack.\n\n               CLEMENZA makes a foul face, and opens the window as the car \n               drives off.\n\n               EXT.

DAY: MALL (1955)\n\n               HIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL\n\n               Several moving vans are parked in the Mall; one feels that \n               these are the final days; the families are moving out; signs \n               indicating that the property is for sale are evident.\n\n               A black limousine pulls up, and before it has even stopped, \n               the rear door flies open, and CONNIE attempts to run out, \n               restrained by MAMA. She manages to break free and runs across \n               the Mall into Michael's house.\n\n               INT. DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (1955)\n\n               Inside the Corleone house.

All the time he knew he \n                         was going to kill my husband. But he \n                         didn't dare while my father was alive.  \n                         And then he stood Godfather to our \n                         child.

DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (1955)\n\n               She moves back into the kitchen and begins to prepare the \n               drinks. From her vantage point, as she smilingly makes the \n               drinks, she sees CLEMENZA, NERI and ROCCO LAMPONE enter the \n               house with their BODYGUARDS.\n\n               She watches with curiosity, as MICHAEL stands to receive \n               them. He stands arrogantly at ease, weight resting on one \n               foot slightly behind the other. One hand on his hip, like a \n               Roman Emperor. The CAPOREGIMES stand before him.\n\n               CLEMENZA takes MICHAEL's hand, kissing it.\n\n                                     CLEMENZA\n                         Don Corleone...\n\n\n\n               The smile fades from KAY's face, as she looks at what her \n               husband has become.\n\n               INT. DAY: CHURCH (1955)\n\n               KAY wears a shawl over her hand.

A SICILIAN LANDSCAPE - FULL VIEW - DAY\n\nWe can barely make out the funeral procession passing over\nthe burnt-brown of a dry river bed.  The figures move\nslowly, seemingly from out of hundreds of years of the past.\n\nThe MUSICIANS walking unsteadily on the rocky bed, their\ninstruments harsh and blaring.\n\nThey are followed by six young peasant men, carrying the\ncrude wooden coffin on their shoulders.  Then the widow, a\nstrong large woman, dressed in black, and not accepting the\narms of those walking with her.\n\nBehind her, not more than twenty relatives, few children and\npaisani continue alone behind the coffin.\n\nSuddenly, we HEAR the shots of the lupara, and the musicians\nstop their playing.  The entire procession scatters in odd\ndirections along the rocky river bed.\n\nThe young men struggle with the burden of the heavy coffin,\nthrowing it out of balance and nearly crashing to the ground.\nWe hear a woman SCREAMING:\n\nWOMAN\n(Sicilian)\n\nThey've killed young Paolo!

In the distance we see four or five of\nthe mourning women, the wind blowing their black dresses and\nveils, running up to the body of the boy.  They begin to\nwail, and cry out in anguished Sicilian, as the widow, the\nmother of the murdered boy, holds her child in her arms, his\nfresh blood wetting her strong hands.\n\nEXT. BARONIAL ESTATE - TIGHT MOVING VIEW - DAY\n\nA boy, eight or nine, with wide, frightened eyes, being\npulled quickly by the hand.  This is VITO ANDOLINI, who is\nto become The Godfather.\n\nThe VIEW ALTERS revealing that he is being pulled along by\nhis Mother, the Widow, across a field leading to the\nornamental gates of a Baronial Estate of some forgotten Noble.\n\nAt various positions near the gates are men with shotguns,\nor lupara.  The gates are opened; and the Widow and her boy\nare shown before DON FRANCESCO, a man in his sixties.  He\nwears his trousers with suspenders, and an open white shirt\nsloppily tucked in over his enormous belly.  He wears a hat\nto protect him from the white-hot sun, and proudly displays\na gold watch and chain over his vest.\n\nHe sits in a chair, near a group of his men in the garden,\nlistening to the Widow, who stands before him with her only\nson.\n\n\n\nWIDOW\n(Sicilian)\n\nDon Francesco.  You murdered my\nhusband, because he would not bend.\nAnd his oldest son Paolo, because\nhe swore revenge.  But Vitone is\nonly nine, and dumb-witted.

He is all I have.

Then\nthere is a lupara blast.  He turns, and sees his Mother\nflung a distance of five feet from the short range of the\nterrible blast of the shotgun.  Then he sees the men turn\ntheir attention to him.  One fires at him; but the boy is\nquick, and disappears into a grove of olive trees.\n\nEXT. STREETS OF CORLEONE - NIGHT\n\nTwo men roam the deserted streets of Corleone, carrying\nlupare.  Every so often, they stop, and one shouts in a\nloud, almost singsong voice, like a fish peddler.

Various painted lines lead to the steps and\nprocessing rooms above.\n\nThere is the babble of many interviews going on\nsimultaneously, uncertainly, in different languages.\n\nVito is bundled in an old coat, with a large tag pinned on\nit: \"Vitone Andolini -- Corleone, Sicilia.\"\n\nHe stands, moves up in the line, when several other immigrant\nboys, older than he, rush up an push him back in the line.\nWeak from the trip, he falls to the floor.  The boys laugh,\nderisive in a language he cannot understand.  He struggles\nto his feet, lifting his makeshift bags; staring at them in\nan icy hatred.\n\nINT. PROCESSING ROOM - DAY\n\nThree or four interviews are crowded into the small room;\nthey are conducted in English.  From the expression on\nVito's face, and from the fragmented of the English, we\nrealize that he doesn't understand a word of it.\n\nOFFICIAL\n(English)\n\nWhat is your name?\n\nThe man waits, impatiently.\n\nOFFICIAL\n\n\n\nYour name?\n\nVito doesn't answer.  The Official pulls the tag pinned onto\nhis coat and copies to down on his form, using a typewriter.\n\nOFFICIAL\n(speaking as he types)\n\nVito...Corleone.

THE STATUE OF LIBERTY - DAY\n\nThe VIEW slowly begins to pull back, revealing this to be\nthe view from inside the quarantine cell, where Vito stands\non his bench, looking out to the statue through the barred\nwindow.\n\nThen he turns, and sits in the corner.

CLOSE VIEW\n\non one of these men, FRANKIE PENTANGELI, approaching his\nsixties, with gray hair (the little of it left).  He's a bit\nscruffy, this morning's shave of his white beard is not\nperfect, and he seems tired.  He is accompanied by an\nassociate-bodyguard, WILLY CICCI; thin and dark, and also\ndressed up for the occasion.  Frankie tries to get the\nattention of one of the waiters; a college-groomed young man\nin white sports jacket and black bow-tie.\n\nPENTANGELI\nHey, kid!  You got any red wine?\n\nWAITER\n(offering the tray)\n\nOnly champagne and cocktails.\n\nPENTANGELI\nForget it...\n\nFinally, he sees someone he recognizes, Fredo, and shouts\nout in a husky voice:\n\nPENTANGELI\nFredo!

Go get me a\nsalami sandwich and a glass of wine\nor I'll send you and your white\njacket to the dry cleaners!\n\nThey get a good laugh at this fresh breath of New York.\n\nFREDO\nGee, Frankie, it's good to see you.\nReminds me of old times.\n\nPENTANGELI\nYou remember Willy Cicci, don't\nyou, Freddie?

Standing before Michael is SANDRA CORLEONE, Sonny's\nwidow; her daughter, one of the twins, FRANCESCA CORLEONE,\nand a handsome young man of twenty, GARDNER SHAW.\n\nSANDRA\nMichael, this is Gardner Shaw.\nFrancesca and he have been seeing\neach other for six months now.\nGardner, this is Francie's Uncle\nMichael.\n\nGARDNER\n(a little nervous)\n\nI've heard a lot about you, Mr.\nCorleone.\n\nMICHAEL (O.S.)\nSit down.  Francie.\n\nThe couple sit themselves on the sofa opposite Michael.\n\nSANDRA\nThey would like to set an engagement\ndate, and...\n\nMICHAEL\nLet them speak for themselves.\n\nVIEW ON MICHAEL, calm, thoughtful.  One can tell that he has\nspecial affection for his niece.\n\nFRANCESCA\nWe love each other, Uncle Michael.\nAnd, we want to be married.  I came\nto ask for your blessing.\n\nThere is a loud KNOCKING on the door; then Fredo's voice.\n\nFREDO (O.S.)\nHey, Mike...guess who's here?\n\nNeri goes to answer it, cracks the door open.\n\nNERI\nNot now, Freddie...\n\nFREDO\nTell Mike Frankie 'Five-Angels' is\nhere.\n\n\n\nNERI\nNot now...\n\nNeri closes the door, and Michael looks at the nervous young\nman.\n\nMICHAEL\nFrancesca is my oldest brother's\ndaughter.  He died many years ago,\nand ever since I've felt much more\nof a father than an uncle.  I love\nher very much.  I'm pleased and\nimpressed that you had the thought\nto come to me before going on with\nyour plans.  It shows me that\nyou're a considerate man, and will\nbe good to her.  What are you\nstudying in college?\n\nGARDNER\nMy major is Fine Arts, sir.\n\nMICHAEL\nHow will Fine Arts support your new\nwife?\n\nGARDNER\nIt's embarrassing to say, sir, but\nI'm a major stockholder in the\nfamily corporation.\n\nMICHAEL\n(smiling)\n\nNever be embarrassed by your wealth.\nThis recent contempt for money is\nstill another trick of the rich to\nkeep the poor without it.\n\n(warmly)\nOf course I give you my blessing.\nLet's set the wedding soon...it\nwill be my pleasure to give the\nbride away.\n\nThey all smile, and rise.\n\nMICHAEL\n(continuing)\n\n...and take a few courses in\nBusiness Administration just to be\non the safe side!\n\nThey laugh; Michael moves toward them.

He owns\na small pizza parlor in Buffalo...\n\nCLOSE ON THE PICTURES\n\nSnapshots of a middle-aged man, handsome, Italian.  There is\nsomething familiar about him.\n\nNERI (O.S.)\n(continuing)\n\n...American wife and two small kids.\nWe traced him and found that he's\nin the country illegally, from\nSicily...\n\nMichael looks at another picture.  The same man.  Only\nyounger, and dressed in Sicilian shepherd's clothing.  We\nremember him as FABRIZZIO...Michael's traitorous bodyguard\nin Sicily.\n\nNERI (O.S.)\n...came over around 1956.  Sponsored\nby the Barzini Family.\n\nMichael puts the pictures down.\n\nMICHAEL\nIt's him.  Fabrizzio.\n\n(almost to himself)\nRevenge is a dish that tastes best\nwhen it's cold.\n\nNERI\nHow do you want me to handle it?\n\nMichael glances at Hagen, who has been waiting in the room.\n\nMICHAEL\nLater.  Tom?\n\nHagen brings him a folder; then, as Michael glances through\nit:\n\nHAGEN\nI've cleared it through the\n\n\n\nSenator's chief aide, a man named\nTurnbull.  Turnbull's a heavy\ngambler, and into us for over a\nhundred grand, so I figure his\ninformation is reliable.\n\nNeri moves to the bar, to prepare Michael a drink.\n\nHAGEN\nThe Senator can be set up; but he\nthinks of himself as a clean\npolitician.  So it's got to be on\nterms he can live with: campaign\ncontribution, donation to a\ncharitable cause that he controls,\nthings like that.  If he gets even\nthe inkling that you think you're\nbuying him, he'll freeze up.\nNevada's a funny state, they like\nthings both ways here... All right.\nTurnbull says the Senator will be\nhere at two-thirty, and he's been\nprimed.  He knows you'll want to\nmeet with him alone, and he knows\nit's about the Tropicana's license.\nAt any rate, he expects to be\nintroduced around to some of the\ninfluential people here today, and\ngenerally treated as an ordinary\nguest.  Just go light on him,\nMikey, sometimes the biggest crooks\ndon't like to think of themselves\nas crooks...\n\nMichael glances at Hagen, as though that last remark was\nunnecessary.\n\nHAGEN\nI'm sorry; of course, you know that.\n\nMICHAEL\nTwo-thirty.  That gives me time to\nsee my boy.\n\nHAGEN\nConnie's outside.\n\nMichael doesn't want to see her.\n\nHAGEN\nI promised; she said it was urgent.\n\nMichael nods.\n\nMICHAEL\nAll right.  Apologize to Pentangeli.\n\nNeri opens the door; Hagen exits, and Connie steps in\nimpatiently, followed by Merle.\n\nMICHAEL\nI said I would see my sister, alone.\n\nMERLE\nI think this concerns me too.\n\n(taking a cigarette\nfrom the dispenser)\n\nYou don't, do you?\n\n\n\nConnie steps forward, kisses Michael on the cheek.\n\nCONNIE\nHow are you, honey?  You've met\nMerle, haven't you.  He was with me\nin Vegas.\n\nMICHAEL\nI saw him with you.\n\nCONNIE\nWe're going to Europe next week.  I\nwant to get passage booked on the\nQueen.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhy do you come to me?  Why don't\nyou go to a travel agent?\n\nMERLE\nWe're going to get married first.\n\nMichael is silent.  Then he rises, and moves to the window\noverlooking the lake.\n\nMICHAEL\nThe ink on your divorce isn't dry.\nYour children see you on weekends;\nyour oldest boy, Michael Francis...\nwas in some trouble with the Reno\npolice over some petty theft that\nyou don't even know about.\n\nCONNIE\nMichael...\n\nMICHAEL\nYou fly around the world with lazy\nyoung men who don't have any love\nfor you, and use you like a whore.\n\nCONNIE\nYou're not my father!\n\nMICHAEL\nThen why do you come to me?\n\nCONNIE\nBecause I need MONEY!\n\nMICHAEL\n(softly)\n\nConnie, I want to be reasonable\nwith you.  You have a house here,\nwith us.  You can live here with\nyour kids...and you won't be\ndeprived of anything.  I don't know\nmuch about Merle; I don't know what\nhe does for a living; what he lives\non.  Why don't you tell him marriage\nis really out of the question; and\nthat you can't see him any more.\nHe'll understand.  But if you\ndisobey me, and marry this pimp...it\nwould disappoint me.\n\nCONNIE\nIt was my father's money; and I'm\nentitled to what I need.  Where is\n\n\n\nTom Hagen?\n\nShe turns angrily, leaving Michael standing face to face\nwith Merle.\n\nMICHAEL\nAre you finished?\n\nMERLE\nI think so.\n\nMICHAEL\nThen out.\n\nMerle puts out his cigarette and leaves, quickly.\n\nEXT. TAHOE PAVILION - FULL VIEW - DAY\n\nThe orchestra has struck up a \"Paul Jones,\" where two\nconcentric circles of young people march in opposite\ndirections, until the music stops.  Then they take whomever\nis opposite them as their new dance partner.\n\nVIEW ON THE HARBOR AREA\n\nFrancesca and her twin, Gardner and their elite young\nfriends roar out of the private harbor, to get up on the\nwater skis.  We notice ROCCO LAMPONE, move along a path\nleading to a separate and more private boathouse.  A small\ncovered craft approaches, ties off, and a group of three men\nstep on to the pathway, shake hands with Lampone - and\nfollow him to the large boathouse where Michael conducts his\nbusiness.\n\nCLOSE VIEW\n\nPentangeli has led Mama up to the dance floor, and is having\nsome difficulty with the orchestra.\n\nPENTANGELI\nI can't believe that out of thirty\nprofessional musicians, not one of\nyou is Italian!\n\n(as the musicians laugh)\nC'mon, give us a tarantella.\n\nHe waves his hands, conducting, and singing.  The piano\nstarts a vamp, the drums uncertainly join in.  A clarinet\nstarts to play \"Pop Goes the Weasel,\" and soon the rest of\nthe orchestra is playing that.  They look to Pentangeli for\napproval.  Disgusted, he goes back to his table, eating a\nhandful of canapes.\n\nINT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY\n\nRocco ushers an older Italian, bundled up against the cold\nand wet of his boatride, to Michael.\n\nThe man shows respect to Michael, who quickly indicates that\nNeri should get him a drink.\n\nMICHAEL\nRocco, his friends must be hungry.\nSee what you can do, but I'd like\nto keep them away from the guests.\n\nThe older man, JOHNNY 'BLUE BOY' OLA, gestures to his\nbodyguards, and they follow Lampone.\n\n\n\nMICHAEL\nYou know my lawyer, Tom Hagen.\nJohnny Ola.\n\nOLA\nSure, I remember Tom from the old\ndays.\n\nTom shakes hands with Ola, remembering him, and his\nimportance.\n\nMICHAEL\nTom isn't going to sit in with us,\nJohnny.  He only handles specific\nareas of the family business.  Tom?\n\nHAGEN\nSure, Mikey.\n\nHe gathers up some of his papers, as the three men remain\nsilent, waiting for him to go before they talk.  It's clear\nTom doesn't want to be excluded.\n\nHAGEN\nIf you need anything, just...\n\nMICHAEL\nJust tell Rocco I'm waiting.\n\nHagen nods and leaves.  As soon as the door closes:\n\nOLA\nI just left our friend in Miami.\n\nMICHAEL\nHow is his health?\n\nOLA\nNot good.\n\nMICHAEL\nIs there anything I can do; anything\nI can send?\n\nOLA\nHe appreciates your concern,\nMichael, and your respect.\n\nThere's a KNOCK on the door; a moment, and then Rocco\nquietly enters and takes his place without disturbing the\nconversation.\n\nOLA\nThe hotel's registered owners are\none Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney\nBarclay, both Beverly Hills\nattorneys.  In reality it's split\nbetween the Old Lakeville Road\nGroup from Cleveland, and our\nfriend in Miami.  He takes care of\nothers outside the country, you\nknow who I mean.  Meyer Klingman\nruns the store, and does all right,\nbut I've been instructed to tell\nyou, that if you move him out, our\nfriend in Miami will go along with\nyou.\n\nMICHAEL\n\n\n\nHe's very kind, tell him it's\nappreciated.  I'm sure it will be\nprofitable all the way around.\n\nOLA\nHe always makes money for his\npartners.  One by one, our old\nfriends are gone.  Death, natural\nor not, prison, deported.  Our\nfriend in Miami is the only one\nleft, because he always made money\nfor his partners.\n\nThe door opens suddenly, and standing there in his white\nCommunion suit, is Michael's boy Anthony.  A moment later,\nKay appears, and takes the boy's hand.\n\nKAY\nAnthony, Daddy's busy.\n\nMICHAEL\n(rising)\n\nThis is my boy, and my wife.  Mr.\nJohn Ola of Miami.\n\nKAY\nI'm sorry, Michael.  Senator\nGeary's here, and Mr. and Mrs.\nBarrett wanted to thank you before\nthey left.  Won't you join us, Mr.\nOla?\n\nMICHAEL\nMr. Ola's just leaving, Kay.\nPlease tell the Senator I won't be\na minute.\n\nPause; she stands there a moment.\n\nMICHAEL\n(continuing)\n\nKay.\n\nKAY\nYes, Michael.\n\nEXT.

Hold this for me until\nI ask for it.  Hurry up!\n\nAutomatically Vito reaches over to the empty space at the\nair shaft, and takes the bundle of rags.

This truck you\nhijacked was in my neighborhood.\nYou should let me wet my beak a\nlittle.\n\nFanucci takes a few of the dresses.\n\nFANUCCI\n(Sicilian)\n\nI understand each of you cleared\naround six hundred dollars.  I\nexpect two hundred dollars for my\nprotection and I'll forget the\ninsult.  After all, young people\ndon't know the courtesies due a man\nlike myself.\n\nVito smiles at him and nods.\n\nFANUCCI\n(Sicilian)\n\nOtherwise the police will come to\nsee you and your wife and children\nwill be dishonored and destitute.\nOf course, if my information as to\nyour gains is incorrect, I'll dip\n\n\n\nmy beak just a little.  Just a\nlittle, but no less than one\nhundred dollars, and don't try to\ndeceive me, eh paisan?\n\nVITO\n(Sicilian)\n (quietly)\n\nMy two friends have my share of the\nmoney.

We'll have\nto pay.  Three hundred, are we\nagreed?\n\nTESSIO\n(Sicilian)\n\nWhat can we do?\n\nClemenza doesn't even bother checking for Vito's opinion.\n\nCLEMENZA\n(Sicilian)\n\nThey say Fanucci has a license from\nMaranzalla himself to work this\nneighborhood.\n\nVITO\n(Sicilian)\n\nIf you like, why not give me fifty\ndollars each to pay Fanucci.  I\nguarantee he will accept that\namount from me.\n\nTESSIO\n(Sicilian)\n\nWhen Fanucci says two hundred he\nmeans two hundred.  You can't talk\nwith him.\n\nVITO\n(Sicilian)\n\nI'll reason with him.  Leave\neverything in my hands.  I'll\nsettle this problem to your\nsatisfaction.\n\nTessio and Clemenza regard him suspiciously.\n\nVITO\n(Sicilian)\n\nI never lie to people I've accepted\nas my friends.  Speak to Fanucci\nyourself tomorrow.  Let him ask you\nfor the money, but don't pay it,\n\n\n\nand don't in any way quarrel with\nhim.  Tell him you have to get the\nmoney and will send me as your\nmessenger.  Let him understand that\nyou're willing to pay what he asks,\ndon't bargain.  I'll go to his\nhouse, and quarrel with him.  He\nlikes me; enjoys explaining how\nthings are here.  He uses ten\nsentences when he only needs one,\nso while he talks, I'll kill him.\n\nClemenza, irritated, makes a large belch, and washes his\nfood down with wine.\n\nCLEMENZA\n(Sicilian)\n\nVitone!\n(to Tessio)\n\nOur driver has drunk too much wine.\n\nTESSIO\n(Sicilian)\n (laughs at himself)\n\nHe's going to kill Fanucci.\n\nCLEMENZA\n(Sicilian)\n (stern)\n\nThen, after that, what?

You read it in the papers?\n\nVITO\n(Sicilian)\n\nThis man informs to the police;\nthis man allows his vengeance to be\nbought off... No, he is alone.\n\nTESSIO\n(Sicilian)\n\nIf you're wrong...\n\nVITO\n(Sicilian)\n\nIf I'm wrong, they will kill me.\n\nBoth Clemenza and Tessio are impressed with their young\nfriend; his willingness to risk his life on his perception\nof the situation.\n\nEXT.

He stops for a sandwich, and makes an irritated\ngesture when the vendor expects to be paid.  He crosses to a\nchurch-sponsored booth with a great Wheel of Fortune, and\nslaps a dollar on a number.  Standing next to him is Vito;\nthey embrace.\n\nCLEMENZA\n(Sicilian)\n (quietly)\n\nAll three daughters are at church;\nhe is alone.  It's important that\nyou let his neighbors see you leave.\nTessio has broken the latch on the\nskylight of his building.\n\nThe wheel stops; they both lose.\n\nCLEMENZA\n(English)\n\nSee, Brother Carmello, even the\nchurch makes numbers.\n\nPRIEST\n(English)\n\nIt's only the way we collect that's\ndifferent.\n\nVito has left while Clemenza jokes with the Priest.\n\nEXT.

Then something catches his eye.\n\nWHAT HE SEES:\n\nA small gray alley cat is attracted to the young man, comes\n\n\n\nup to him and rubs itself against him.  Vito rubs the\nanimal, speaking softly in Sicilian, then, gaining its\nconfidence, lifts it up and carefully lets it into Fanucci's\napartment.\n\nHe steps back, holding the gun.  We HEAR some Italian\nshouted in the house; a loud sound from the cat, and some of\nthe thumping footsteps of Fanucci.\n\nVIEW ON VITO\n\nholding the wrapped gun, waiting.\n\nWHAT HE SEES:\n\nThe white blob of Fanucci opening the door and cursing in\nItalian as he throws the cat out.\n\nVIEW ON VITO\n\nsqueezing the trigger; the muffled, but still LOUD BLAST\nresounding in the building.\n\nVIEW ON FANUCCI\n\nHe holds onto the door frame, trying to stand erect, trying\nto reach for his gun.  The force of his struggle has torn\nthe buttons off his jacket and made it swing loose.  His gun\nis exposed but so is a spidery vein on the white shirtfront\nof his stomach.  Carefully, as if plunging a needle into\nthis vein, Vito Corleone fires a second bullet.\n\nFanucci falls to his knees, propping the door open, giving a\nterrible groan.  We begin to hear the VOICES of girls inside\nthe apartment.\n\nVito quickly opens his wallet, removes the two hundred,\nquickly fires one last bullet into Fanucci's sweaty cheek.\nNow the towel the gun was wrapped with catches fire,\nliterally on Vito's hand; quickly he throws it to the\nground, stamps it out...and disappears upward.\n\nEXT.

Then, without a\nsecond's hesitation, he leaps to the floor, still holding\nhis son's drawing, as a spray of machine gun bullets sweep\nacross the windows; glass shattering all over the room.\n\nKay screams out; rising, still half-asleep.  Michael crawls\ntoward her, and pulls her down to the floor to him.\n\nThen, for a moment, there is silence, soon filled by the\nshouts of men; as flashes of light sweep by the window, as\nguards with flashlights come running.\n\nMichael holds Kay to him, knowing they have both survived,\nand then gently:\n\nMICHAEL\nGo with the kids.\n\nEXT. THE TAHOE ESTATE - NIGHT\n\nSuddenly, the great floodlights are turned on, bathing lawns\nin an intense blue light.\n\nGroups of ordinarily dressed security men drawn in from all\ndirections; a state of confusion prevails.  There is no sign\nof the attackers.\n\nVIEW BY MICHAEL'S HOUSE\n\nMichael is joined by Rocco Lampone, his gun drawn.\n\nROCCO\nThey're still on the property.\nMaybe you better stay inside.\n\nMICHAEL\nKeep them alive.\n\nSix men take up posts by Michael's house.\n\nROCCO\nWe'll try.\n\nMICHAEL\nIt's important.\n\nHe returns inside.\n\nEXT. MAIN GATE AND KENNELS - NIGHT\n\nThe character of the summer estate has changed: bright\nfloodlights illuminate the main points of entry: the main\ngate; the waterway; the stone wall that encompasses the\nestate on all sides.\n\nSeveral men with flashlights reinforce the guard at the main\ngate.\n\nFULL VIEW\n\nOff in the distance, we see another group of men with\nflashlights combing the waterline.  We hear indistinguishable\nshouts.\n\nVIEW ON THE KENNELS\n\n\n\nThe wire gates are opened, and the trained dogs go out\nyelping into the outer edge of the estate.\n\nROOFTOP\n\nOne of Rocco's men turns the large floodlight scanning\ndarkened forest areas, where men could hide.\n\nMOVING VIEW\n\nMen with flashlights and dogs.

MICHAEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nSome of the bodyguards by the shattered windows of Michael's\nbedroom.\n\nThe curtains are drawn from inside.\n\nINT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nKay, the children, and some women servants have come down\nfrom the various rooms into the central living area, that\ncan be most easily secured.  The little girl is still\nasleep; they make you think of an immigrant family, with\ntheir blankets and frightened faces, all waiting in a\ncentral room.\n\nMichael goes up to Kay, squeezes her hand, and whispers:\n\nMICHAEL\nIt will be all right.  We were lucky.\n\nShe says nothing; but her face expresses the anger she feels\nover the jeopardy Michael has placed his children in.  She\nholds her young daughter in her arms.\n\nThe door opens, and Rocco enters.  He quickly realizes he is\nholding his gun in plain view in front of the family, and\nputs it away.  Michael moves to him, and they talk a distance\naway from Kay.\n\nROCCO\nYour family all seem to be okay in\nthe other houses; your Mother's\nstill sleeping.\n\nMICHAEL\nAnd?\n\nROCCO\nNo sign of them yet; but they're\nstill on the Estate.\n\nWe HEAR loud shouting from outside.\n\nDEANNA (O.S.)\nGoddamn you!  You're all nuts here,\nI'm not goin' to calm down...\n\nMICHAEL'S VIEW\n\nThrough the door, that Rocco opens.\n\n\n\nDeanna, in her nightgown, has been frightened by the\ngunshots; while Fredo in his bathrobe, tries to get her back\ninto the house.\n\nFREDO\nDeanna, will you get back into the\nhouse!\n\nDEANNA\nI'm getting out of here I said;\nthese guys all have guns!\n\nMICHAEL\nFredo, can't you shut that woman up!\n\n(to Rocco's men)\nGet her in here!\n\nThe bodyguards, gracefully help Fredo bring the hysterical\nDeanna into the safety of the house.\n\nDEANNA\n(whimpering)\n\nI don't want to stay here...\n\nFREDO\nMike, what can I do, she's a\nhysterical woman...\n\nKAY\nLeave her alone!

TAHOE ESTATE - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT\n\nMichael walks the short distance from his house, to the\nboathouse where he conducts his business away from his family.\n\nA small group of bodyguards, carrying machine guns, make the\nwalk with him from all sides, a respectful distance away.\nIt gives the appearance of a lonely President moving in his\ncompound, followed by teams of Secret Service men.\n\nThe boathouse is already secured by teams of men, hastily\nwakened from their lodge house; a barracks-like structure\nwhere reinforcements are lodged just for this kind of\nemergency.\n\nFULL VIEW\n\nIn the distance, we can see the teams of men and dogs, with\ntheir lights, guns and shouts, combing every inch of the\nestate.\n\nINT. THE BOATHOUSE - EMPTY VIEW - NIGHT\n\nMichael alone in the great room.  He moves to a walk-in\nsafe, quickly runs through the combination, and opens it.\nHe takes out an envelope, and puts it into his pocket;\nthere's a KNOCK on the door, and Hagen enters.  He had been\nasleep, and has quickly thrown on a robe.\n\n\n\nMICHAEL\nSit down, Tom.\n\nEXT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - NIGHT\n\nFrom outside the leaded windows, a disoriented Hagen sits\ndown; Michael starts to talk to him; obviously about\nsomething very serious.\n\nThe patrol securing the boathouse, walk past the window.\nMichael says something to Tom, who rises, and pulls the\ndrapes, obscuring OUR VIEW.\n\nINT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - NIGHT\n\nMichael talks intimately to Tom.\n\nMICHAEL\nThere's a lot I can't tell you, Tom.\nI know that's upset you in the\npast; and you've felt that it was\nbecause of some lack of trust or\nconfidence.  But it is because I do\ntrust you that I've kept so much\nsecret from you.  It's precisely\nthat at this moment, you are the\nonly one that I can completely\ntrust.  In time, you'll understand\neverything.\n\nHAGEN\n(nods with this statement)\n\nBut your people... Neri... Rocco;\nyou don't think...\n\nMICHAEL\nNo, I have confidence in their\nloyalty... but this is life and\ndeath, and Tom, you are my brother.\n\nHagen in very moved.\n\nHAGEN\nMikey, I hoped...\n\nMICHAEL\nNo Tom, just listen.  All my people\nare businessmen; their loyalty is\nbased on that.  One thing I learned\nfrom my father is to try to think\nas the people around you think...and\non that basis, anything is possible.\nFredo has a good heart, but he is\nweak...and stupid, and stupid\npeople are the most dangerous of\nall.  I've kept you out of things,\nTom, because I've always known that\nyour instincts were legitimate, and\nI wanted you to know very little of\nthings that would make you an\naccomplice, for your own protection.\nI never blamed you for the setbacks\nthe family took under Sonny; I know\nyou were in a position of limited\npower, and you did your best to\nadvise and caution him.  What I am\nsaying is that now, for how long I\ndo not know, you will be the Don.\nIf what I think has happened is\n\n\n\ntrue; I will leave tonight, and\nabsolutely no one will know how to\ncontact me.  And even you are not\nto try to reach me unless it is\nabsolutely necessary.  I give you\ncomplete power: over Neri... Fredo,\neveryone.  I am trusting you with\nthe lives of my wife and children,\nand the future of this family,\nsolely resting on your judgment and\ntalent.\n\nVIEW ON HAGEN\n\nA man who has steadily declined over the last five years,\nrealizing that total power and responsibility is being\nplaced on him.\n\nMICHAEL\n(continuing)\n\n...But Tom, you must know that I do\nthis only because I believe you are\nthe only one who is capable of\ntaking over for me.\n\nVIEW ON MICHAEL\n\ntaking out the envelope.\n\nMICHAEL\nI've prepared this; have had it for\nover a month.  It won't explain\neverything; but indicates where I\nwill be, so in a sense, it is my\nlife.\n\n(he hands the envelope\nto Hagen)\n\nAlso, there are three tasks that\nmust be executed immediately.  Pop\nwould have given those to Luca --\nYou knew Pop as well as anyone, act\nas though you were him.  It\ndiscusses Kay as well; that will be\nthe most difficult.  The men who\ntried to kill me tonight, will\nnever leave the estate.\n\nHAGEN\nWill we...be able to get who\nordered it out of them?\n\nMICHAEL\nI don't think so.  Unless I'm very\nwrong...they're already dead.\nKilled by someone inside...very\nfrightened that they botched it.\nThat's why I am going to disappear\nin a few minutes, and leave\neverything to you.\n\nHAGEN\nBut if you're wrong...\n\nMICHAEL\nIf I'm wrong...\n\nThere is a KNOCK on the door.\n\nMICHAEL\n\n\n\n...I don't think I'm wrong.\n(he indicates the knock)\n\nYes.\n\nThe door opens; it is Rocco; Michael rises, after making a\nknowing glance toward Tom, and moves to talk quietly to a\nfrightened and agitated Rocco.\n\nEXT. STONE WALL AND STREAM - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT\n\nA group of men with flashlights and guns lead Michael, Tom\nand Rocco to the stone bridge spanning the stream which runs\nthrough the estate.\n\nLOW CLOSE VIEW\n\nMichael's dispassionate face, looking down.  THE VIEW MOVES\nto Hagen's, and then down to the murky water under the\nbridge, where we see the bodies of three strangers, lying in\nthe moving water; machine-type guns nearby, with their\nthroats cut.  Light from the many flashlights illuminates\nthe grotesque scene.\n\nMICHAEL (O.S.)\nFish them out.\n\nSeveral of the men wade down into the stream; Rocco helps,\nand even Tom steps down to get a better look at who they\nwere.  They are total strangers; Rocco examines the type of\nguns they used.\n\nWhen they climb back onto the ground, Michael is gone.\nEveryone notices it, but no one says anything.\n\nHagen stands there, holding the envelope Michael had given\nhim in his hand.\n\nHe realizes that now, he is the DON.\n\nHAGEN\nGet rid of the bodies.  Tomorrow\nmorning I want a report made to the\nlocal police, and paper, that some\nexplosives we keep on the property\nwere accidentally ignited.\n\nThe men respond; Hagen makes the lonely walk back to the\nlighted section of the compound, which now resembles a\nprison camp.\n\nFADE OUT.\n\nFADE IN:\n\nINT. STATE SENATE FLOOR - DAY\n\nThe Senate is in session; Senator Geary is on the floor\nduring a vote.  An aide approaches him, with a slip of paper.\n\nINT.

No strings.\n\nSENATOR GEARY\nNo strings.\n\nHAGEN\nYou know there's a Senate\nInvestigating Committee recently\nset up; we thought it would be\nunfortunate if they were to trace\nanything though-provoking to your\nname.\n\nSENATOR GEARY\nNo one can trace anything to me; I\npride myself on that.\n\nHAGEN\nDo you gamble?\n\nSENATOR GEARY\nA little; what's so thought-\nprovoking about that?\n\nHAGEN\nDo you owe markers?\n\nSENATOR GEARY\nMaybe two, three thousand dollars.\n\nHagen leans forward, and deposits a handful of paper on the\nSenator's desk.\n\nHAGEN\nThe Corleone family has paid them\noff for you...as an expression of\nour esteem.\n\nGeary quickly looks through the paid markers.\n\nSENATOR GEARY\nThere's thirty grand worth of paid\noff markers -- I never owed that\nmuch.\n\nHAGEN\nOur mistake.  But what does it\nmatter; it was our money.\n\n(rising)\nWe don't even expect thanks.\n\nSENATOR GEARY\n\n\n\nYou paid off thirty grand I never\nowed.\n\nHAGEN\nWe'll keep it quiet; the people who\nknow are trustworthy...the Committee\nneedn't find out.\n\nSENATOR GEARY\nAnd what's the price of their not\nfinding out.\n\nHAGEN\nSimple.

We can send out for\nanything you need.\n\nKAY\nI'm supposed to stay in my house.\n\nHAGEN\nWithin the compound will be fine.\n\nKAY\nI was supposed to take the children\nto New England next week.\n\nHAGEN\nThat's off now.\n\nKAY\nI'm going to see my parents.\n\nHAGEN\nKay, Michael didn't tell me a lot;\nand what he did tell me, I can't\nrepeat.

But, let me tell you,\nthe important thing is that you're\nall right.  Good health is the most\nimportant thing; more than success;\nmore than power; more than money.\n\nMICHAEL\nThe incident of the other night is\na nuisance that I can take care of.\nI came to you because I want\nnothing to affect our agreement; I\nwanted to clear everything I'm\ngoing to do with you, just in case.\n\nROTH\nYou're a considerate young man.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou're a great man, Mr. Roth, I\nhave much to learn from you.\n\nROTH\n(warmly)\n\nHowever I can help you...\n\nMICHAEL\nThe Rosato Brothers have performed\nservices for you in the past; I\nunderstand that they are under your\nprotection.\n\nROTH\n(simply)\n\nWe do favors for each other...\n\nMICHAEL\nTechnically, they are still under\nthe Clemenza wing of the Corleone\nFamily, now run by Frankie\nPentangeli.

Who should be the\nmanager of a dime store, Joe or\nJack?  Unimportant.  You do what\nyou think is right.  You're a young\nman, and I'm old and sick.  What we\ndo together in the next few months\nwill be history, Michael; it has\nnever been done before.  We will do\nthis historical thing together, and\neven your Father could never dream\nit would be possible.

No more taxes to you.  We\nwant to be only loosely connected\nwith your family -- sort of a\nunder-family all of our own.  Then\nwe can act on all internal matters\nwithout talking.  Also we want you\nto inform Michael Corleone that we\ncan deal directly with him.\n\nPENTANGELI\nI'm a little hungry, maybe I'll\norder something.

Number two, we're here\nfor you to count on when you need\nus.  We're independent, but we're\nhere if you need us.

That puts me\nand the other New York families\nagainst you.\n\nROSATO\nWe got friends in the commission.\n\n\n\nPENTANGELI\n(getting angry)\n\nI'm talking about Italians!\n\nROSATO\nWhat about Michael Corleone?\n\nPENTANGELI\nHe supports me.\n\nROSATO\nMaybe, yes... maybe no.\n\nOne of Pentangeli's men approaches with a plate of Italian\nfood.\n\nPentangeli stands up, angered by this remark of Rosato's; he\npushes the dish of food out of the surprised Bodyguard's\nhands.\n\nPENTANGELI\nYou drove old Pete Clemenza to his\ngrave, Carmine; you and your\nbrother.  Turning on him; trouble\nin his territories -- you and your\ndemands.  I hold you responsible,\njust as though you shot him in the\nhead.  And I ain't gonna let that\ngo for long!\n\nPentangeli walks out of the restaurant; there's a little\ntension between the bodyguards of the two factions.\n\nROSATO (O.S.)\nHey, Five-Angels...\n\nHe gives him the arm.\n\nFrankie's face turns red, like he wants to have it out here\nand now; but Willy Cicci calms his down, and they all make\ntheir move out.\n\nEXT.

PENTANGELI'S LONG BEACH ESTATE - DAY\n\nPart of the old estate of Don Corleone.  By now, the wall\nhas been torn down, and the other houses sold off.\n\nHis car is parked; Pentangeli steps out, still angry over\nthe confrontation.  As he approaches the house, he notices\nsomething strained about the bodyguards who discreetly guard\nhis house.  No one seems to want to tell him.\n\nPENTANGELI\nWhat's up?\n\nPentangeli glances over to the front door foyer.\n\nPENTANGELI'S VIEW\n\n\n\nThe strange and silent Bussetta, the man who now always\ntravels with Michael.\n\nINT. PENTANGELI'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nPentangeli enters; he sees his WIFE, standing oddly in the\nhallway.\n\nPENTANGELI\n(Sicilian)\n\nWhat's this?\n\nWIFE\nMichael Corleone.\n\nPENTANGELI\nOne Michael Corleone...Dove?\n\nWIFE\n(Sicilian)\n\nHe's in your study.\n\nHe knows it is very very serious for Michael to be here in\nhis home.\n\nHe automatically moves into his study.\n\nINT. PENTANGELI'S STUDY - DAY\n\nMichael stands quietly in the room.  This was once his\nfather's study, although it is totally redecorated.\nPentangeli starts sweating, and moves toward the young Don,\nand kisses his hand.\n\nPENTANGELI\nDon Corleone, I wish you let me\nknow you was coming.  We could have\nprepared something for you.\n\nMICHAEL\nI didn't want you to know I was\ncoming.  You heard what happened in\nmy home?\n\nPENTANGELI\nMichael, yes, we was all relieved...\n\nMICHAEL\n(furious)\n\nIn my home!  In the same room where\nmy wife was sleeping; where my\nchildren come in their pajamas, and\nplay with their toys.\n\nHe's terrified Pentangeli with his anger; then, just as\nsuddenly, he talks quietly, calmly.\n\nMICHAEL\nI want you to help me take my\nrevenge.\n\nPENTANGELI\nMichael, anything.  What is it I\ncan do for you?\n\nMICHAEL\nI want you to settle these troubles\nwith the Rosato Brothers.\n\n\n\nPENTANGELI\nI was just going to contact you,\nMichael; we just had a 'sit-down' -\nin fact, I just come from there.\n\nMICHAEL\nI want you to settle on their terms.\n\nPENTANGELI\nMike, I don't understand.  Don't\nask me to do that.\n\nMICHAEL\nTrust me; do as I ask.\n\nPENTANGELI\nIt would be the beginning of the\nend for my family.  How can I keep\nall my other territories in like if\nI let two wise-guys stand up and\ndemand this and that, and then give\nit to them?\n\nMICHAEL\nFrankie...do you respect me?  Do I\nhave your loyalty?\n\nPENTANGELI\nAlways... But sometimes I don't\nunderstand.  I know I'll never have\nyour kind of brains, in big deals.\nBut Mike, this is a street thing.\nAnd Hyman Roth in Miami is behind\nthe Rosato Brothers.\n\nMICHAEL\nI know.\n\nPENTANGELI\nThen why do you want me to lay down\nto them?\n\nMICHAEL\n(coldly, but convincing)\n\nFrankie, Roth tried to have me\nkilled.  I'm sure it was him, but I\ndon't know yet why.\n\nPENTANGELI\nJesus Christ, Michael, then let's\nhit 'em now, while we still got the\nmuscle.\n\nMICHAEL\nThis was my father's old study.\nWhen I was a kid, we had to be\nquiet when we played near here.\nWhen I was older, I learned many\nthings from him here.  I was happy\nthat this house never went to\nstrangers; first Clemenza took it\nover, and then you.  My father\ntaught me, in this room, never to\nact until you know everything\nthat's behind things.  Never.  If\nHyman Roth sees that I interceded\nwith you in the Rosato Brothers'\nfavor, he'll think his relationship\nwith me is still sound.  I'm going\n\n\n\nsomewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We\nhave friends in some very important\nbusiness that we're making.  Do\nthis for me; you make the peace\nwith the Rosato Brothers on their\nterms.  Let the word out that I\nforced you; you're not happy wit\nhit, but acquiesced, just because\nof me.  It will get back to Hyman\nRoth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can\ntrust me.\n\nPENTANGELI\nSure, Mike.  I'll go along.\n\nMICHAEL\nGood.\n\nThey embrace; Michael kisses him.  He looks at the young\nDon, thoughtfully.\n\nINT. TROPICANA HOTEL - CLOSE VIEW - DAY\n\nThe money trays are carefully unloaded from the gaming\ntables, and put on a cart with others.\n\nThe cart, preceded and followed by security guards, is then\nwheeled through the casino, into a private, counting room.\n\nINT. COUNTING ROOM - MED. VIEW - DAY\n\nThe guards leave the room; the door is locked after them,\nleaving only Hagen.  Neri and an ACCOUNTANT, a very fat man.\nThe numbered boxes are opened, and cash and checks are\nspread out on the counting table.\n\nThe accountant begins with amazing speed and skill, to count\nand divide the money.\n\nNERI\nFifteen percent skim?\n\nHAGEN\nTwenty-five this time.\n\nThe accountant stops, and looks up to Neri.\n\nNERI\nIt might show.\n\nHAGEN\nMike wants it.\n\nNeri nods, and the accountant continues.  Neri opens a door,\nallowing a sandy-haired man, a COURIER, into the room.  The\ncream is placed into his pouch personally by Neri.\n\nNERI\nWe've never sent this much with one\ncourier.\n\nHAGEN\n(to the courier)\n\nYour plans are a little different\nthis time.  You skip Miami, and go\nstraight to Geneva.  It's to be\ndeposited to this number.\n\n(handing him a small envelope)\nAnd it's got to be there by Monday\n\n\n\nmorning, no slip-up.\n\nCOURIER\nI think I was 'picked-up' last trip.\nThat hour layover I had at Kennedy.\nI went over and bought a paper...\n\nNeri has finished putting the 'creamed' money into the pouch.\n\nNERI\nThose were our people.\n\nCOURIER\nOkay, just thought you should know.\n\nHe is just about to close and lock the pouch, when Hagen\ngestures that he should wait, and adds more stacks of\ncarefully packaged bills into the pouch.  Then Neri locks\nit, and handcuffs it to the courier's arm, looking\ninquiringly at Hagen.\n\nHAGEN\nLet them count.\n\nThe courier is shown out through a private door, and then\nthe first door is opened.  Two accountants come in with the\nguards, and the trays are opened, and the counting process\nis begun all over again, this time with the State Tally\nsheets.\n\nINT. TROPICANA CORRIDOR - MOVING VIEW - DAY\n\nThe courier continues on his way; followed by Hagen and Neri.\n\nNERI\nWhat's up?\n\nHAGEN\nNo questions.\n\nNERI\nI got to ask questions, Tom,\nthere's three million dollars cash\nin that pouch; Mike is gone and I\nhave no word from him.\n\nHAGEN\nAl, as far as you're concerned, I'm\nthe Don.\n\nNERI\nHow do I know you haven't gone into\nbusiness for yourself?\n\nThis hurts Tom; but he is a reasonable man, and he knows he\nowes Neri some explanation.\n\nHAGEN\nYou've been through a lot with us\nso I'm going to give you the truth.\nMike knows it was someone within\nthe compound that set him up for\nthat hit.  So nobody is to know\nwhere he is, not you, not Rocco,\nnot even his brother Fredo.  Sorry,\nAl, I know how you feel about\nMike...but he still remembers Tessio.\n\nEXT. KEY WEST - NIGHT\n\n\n\nMichael is led to a desolate, night-lit private dock.  He is\nfollowed by the ever-present Bussetta, and they are helped\nonto a light-weight, luxury cabin cruiser.  The crew cast\noff various ropes, and the boat sets out into the night.\n\nFADE OUT.\n\nFADE IN:\n\nEXT. TAHOE ESTATE - DAY\n\nA seaplane lands nicely by the private Corleone harbor;\nHagen disembarks with his inevitable overloaded briefcase.\nHe continues down the ramp, past several Buttonmen, dressed\nin summer casual attire, and who resemble secret service men\nrather than thugs.\n\nHis wife THERESA lies on a blanket on the great lawn, with\nher youngest children, who run to their father for a kiss.\n\nTHERESA\nHungry?\n\nHAGEN\nJust a little.\n\nTHERESA\nI've invited Mama, Sandra and the\nkids for barbecue.\n\nHAGEN\nWhat about Kay?\n\nTHERESA\nI couldn't find her.  She's been so\nbroody, sticks to herself.\n\nEXT. TAHOE LAWN BARBECUE - MED. VIEW - DAY\n\nHagen and Sonny's boys are throwing a football around on the\nlawn; the littler kids running after them.\n\nCoals are burning in the old style stone barbecue, and\nseveral tables are set for the family.\n\nIn the distance, there is always evidence of the bodyguards.\n\nTheresa, Mama and Sandra prepare the steaks.\n\nHagen relaxes in a sports shirt.\n\nHAGEN\nLet me try Kay.\n\nHe crosses the lawn, to the house on the beach where Michael\nand his family live.  Is about to knock on the door:\n\nHAGEN'S SON\nHey, Pop, heads up!\n\nThe football is flying in his direction; he catches it and\nthrows it back.  Then he cracks the door open, and peeks in.\n\nINT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nHAGEN\nKay?\n\n\n\nHe steps in, the beautiful summer living room is neat, but\nempty.\n\nHAGEN\nAnyone hungry?\n\nHe moves through the house more quickly; into the dining and\nrecreation room areas.  A cat jumps off a pile of cushions\nand runs across the room.\n\nHAGEN\nHello?\n\nSANDRA (O.S.)\nShe's gone, Tom.\n\nSandra has followed him into Michael's house.\n\nHAGEN\nWhat do you mean gone?\n\nSANDRA\nThe Barretts from Rubicon Bay came\nby in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried\nto say she wasn't in, but Kay\nspotted them and asked if they\nwould take her and the kids for a\nride.  That was three hours ago.\n\nHAGEN\n(furious)\n\nWhy didn't someone tell me!\n\nSANDRA\nI wanted to tell you alone; your\nwife doesn't know what's going on.\n\nHagen rushes out of the house.\n\nEXT. TAHOE LAWN - DAY\n\nHagen moves quickly out of Michael's house; moving across\nthe lawn to the boathouse.\n\nHAGEN'S SON\nHey, Dad!\n\nThis time he ignores the thrown ball, and moves directly to\nRocco, who is by some men near the boathouse.\n\nHAGEN\nRocco!\n\nROCCO\nI know.  I went down to the Barrett\nhouse.  But she's gone.  They drove\nher and the kids to North Tahoe\nairport.\n\nHAGEN\nGoddamn it, where were you?\n\nROCCO\nI was in my house.  Willy tried,\nbut it would have taken some\nstrong-arm to stop her, and he\nfigured you wouldn't want that.\n\nINT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY\n\n\n\nThey enter the boathouse.\n\nHAGEN\n(to one of the men)\n\nGet me a Scotch and water.\n\nThe man hurries behind the bar.\n\nROCCO\nShe took a flight to San Francisco.\nWe figure she's going to connect to\nNew Hampshire; her parents' place.\n\nHAGEN\n(almost to himself)\n\nI can't let him down.\n\nHe swallows the drink down in several gulps.  And then looks\nup to his men watching him.  He's embarrassed to have shown\nsuch weakness.\n\nHAGEN\nAll right, let me think a minute.\n\nRocco clears the men out.\n\nROCCO\nMe too, Tom?\n\nHAGEN\nYeah, give me a minute.\n\nRocco gone, Hagen moves behind the enormous bar, and pours\nhimself a giant drink.  He drinks that, and calms himself.\n\nHAGEN\nOh Christ, Pop.  It was so good\nwhen you were alive.  I felt I\ncould handle anything...\n\nEXT.

HAVANA STREET - MOVING VIEW - DAY\n\nMichael and Bussetta are driven in a Mercury sedan, making\nits way through the streets of Havana.\n\nCLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL\n\nlooking out the window.\n\nMICHAEL'S POV\n\nCrowded streets, occasional roving bands playing for the\ntourists; there is much evidence of tourism: Americans\n\n\n\nwalking through the streets with cameras.  Occasionally, we\nsee a Cuban with a row of numbers attached to his hat,\ncarrying a big sheet of the daily lottery numbers.  From all\nof these street impressions, the city is booming with\nactivity, but there is also much evidence of whores and\npimps and little children begging in the streets.\n\nMED. VIEW\n\nThe big American car stops at an intersection.  Bussetta is\nsitting in the forward passenger side; while Michael is in\nthe back.  He hears tapping on the window; he turns and sees\nfour Cuban boys tapping on his window and extending their\nhands, and rubbing their stomachs as though they were hungry.\nThe Cuban driver rolls down his window and shouts them away\nin Spanish.\n\nINT. HAVANA CASINO LOBBY - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT\n\nMichael is led through a beautiful wooden lobby of the\nhotel, done in Spanish style, apparently just recently\ncompleted.  He is approached by a thin, mousy man, SAM ROTH,\nwho ushers him toward the casino entrance.\n\nSAM ROTH\nHiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth.\nWelcome to the Capri; my brother's\nupstairs.  You wanta take a rest\nbefore you see him, or can I get\nyou something, anything at all?\n\nMICHAEL\nNo, I'm fine.\n\nHe leads Michael into the main casino.\n\nSAM ROTH\nThis is it!  We think it makes\nVegas look like the corner crap game.\n\nMICHAEL\nVery impressive.\n\nSAM ROTH\nJake, Jake, come over here.  Mike,\nI want you to meet Jake Cohen; he\nmanages the casino for us.\n\nCOHEN\n(appreciating\nMichael's status)\n\nMr. Corleone.\n\nSam turns to Bussetta and extends his glad-hand.\n\nSAM ROTH\nPleasure to meet you, I'm sure...\n\nHe gets no response whatsoever from Bussetta.\n\nINT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT\n\nAn extremely tall, well-built Cuban, tanned and wearing an\nattractive mustache, LEON, in his middle forties, reads from\na prepared paper.  His sentences are translated by a smaller\nman, standing to his rear.\n\nLEON\n(Spanish)\n\n\n\nMost respected gentlemen, allow me\nto welcome you to the City of\nHavana, the Republic of Cuba on\nbehalf of His Excellency, Fulgencio\nBatista.\n\nTHE VIEW BEGINS TO MOVE along the various men gathered for\nthis meeting.\n\nLEON (O.S.)\nI'd like to thank this distinguished\ngroup of American Industrialists,\nfor continuing to work with Cuba,\nfor the greatest period of\nprosperity in her entire history.\nMr. William Proxmiro, representing\nthe General Fruit Company...

And Mr. Hyman\nRoth of Miami, and Michael Corleone\nof Nevada representing our\nAssociates in Tourism and Leisure\nActivities.\n\nVIEW ON THE ENTIRE GROUP\n\nLeon pauses to take a drink of water.  Then proudly, he\nlifts a shiny yellow telephone for all to see.\n\nLEON\nThe President would like to take\nthis opportunity to thank U T&T for\ntheir lovely gift: a solid gold\ntelephone!  He thought all you\ngentlemen would care to take a look\nat it.\n\nHe hands the heavy phone set to one of his aides, and it is\npassed in turn to each of the men in attendance.\n\nCORNGOLD\nYour Excellency, perhaps you could\ndiscuss the status of rebel activity\nand how this may affect our\nbusinesses.\n\nMED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL\n\nHe receives the telephone, and glances at it before passing\nit on to Hyman Roth.\n\nLEON (O.S.)\nOf course.  The rebel movement is\nbasically unpopular, and since July\nof 1958 has been contained in the\nOriente Province, in the mountains\nof the Sierra Muestre.\n\nMichael passes the phone on to Roth.\n\nLEON\n(continuing)\n\nWe began a highly successful\n\n\n\noffensive against them in March,\nand activities within the city\nitself are at a minimum.  I can\nassure you we'll tolerate no\nguerrillas in the casinos or\nswimming pools!\n\nGeneral subdued laughter.\n\nA CUBAN STREET - LATE DAY\n\nPolice are stopping traffic.  Michael's Mercury is among the\ncars; a police officer, seeing that some important person is\nbeing driven, walks up to the driver.  He leans forward, and\nsays something in Spanish to the driver.\n\nThe driver, in turn, leans over to Michael.\n\nDRIVER\nHe says it will just be a short\ntime and they'll let us through.\n\nMichael looks out the window.\n\nMICHAEL'S VIEW\n\nThe old building has been totally surrounded by police and\nmilitary vehicles.  Right at this moment, they are waiting\nlazily, but soldiers are there with automatic weapons ready.\nThere is a momentary commotion inside the building, and the\nmen brace up.  A Captain of the Army detachment says\nsomething in Spanish over a megaphone; and his men put their\nweapons at the ready, as other policemen lead a group of\ncivilians out of the building with their hands up.\n\nThey are moved over to some military truck, where they are\nfrisked before being loaded.\n\nAll of a sudden, one of the civilian rebels breaks loose,\nand rushes toward the command vehicle.  He hurls himself\ninto the vehicle, as two police try to pull him out.  A\nsecond later, and there is an explosion; the man obviously\nhaving hidden a grenade on his body, sacrificing his own\nlife to take the life of the Captain.\n\nThere is a commotion, but the military quickly quell it.\n\nCLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL\n\nwatching.  The police rush to Michael's car and guide it\noutside of the trouble area.\n\nMED. VIEW\n\nas they lead and escort the Mercury out of the area.\n\nEXT. HAVANA COUNTRY CLUB - CLOSE VIEW - DAY\n\nSome glasses; rum is poured into them; then Coca Cola.\nQuarter limes are squeezed.\n\nSAM ROTH (O.S.)\nRum... Coca Cola...a squeeze of\nfresh lime...\n\nSam prepares the drinks for his brother, Hyman, and a group\nof men, including Michael.\n\nMAN\n\n\n\nCuba Libres.\n\nMICHAEL\nI was told the Cubans now call this\ndrink: \"La Mentira.\"\n\nROTH\nI still don't speak Spanish, Michael.\n\nMICHAEL\nIt means... \"The Lie.\"\n\nA moment's hesitation, then a few of the men laugh.  Now two\nCubans in white carry a table which has a lovely small cake\non it.\n\nSAM ROTH\nThe cake is here.\n\nThey all raise their glasses to the old man.\n\nEVERYONE\n(ad lib)\n\nHappy Birthday!\n\nRoth glances at the cake and its inscription, is pleased.\n\nROTH\nI hope my age is correct: I am\nalways accurate about my age.\n\nSome laugh.  He nods, and they begin to cut it, put a piece\non plates, and carry them to the different men.\n\nROTH\nEverything we've learned in Vegas\nis true here; but we can go further.\nThe bigger, the swankier, the\nplusher the store, the more a sense\nof legitimacy, and the bigger\nbusiness we do.\n\n(looking at the plate\nbrought to him)\n\nA smaller piece.  What we've\nproposed to the Cuban Government is\nthat it put up half the cash on a\ndollar for dollar basis.\n\n(accepting a smaller piece)\nThank you.  We can find people in\nthe United States who will put up\nour share for a small piece of the\naction, yet we will retain control.\n\nONE OF THE MEN\nHow much?\n\nROTH\nA hundred million dollars.  But\nonly if this Government relaxes its\nrestrictions on importing building\nmaterials; we'll need some new\nlaws, too, but that will be no\ndifficulty.\n\nANOTHER MAN\nWhat are import duties now?\n\nROTH\nAs much as seventy percent.  Also,\n\n\n\nI'm working out an arrangement with\nthe Minister of Labor so that all\nour pit bosses, stick-men and\nDealers, can be considered\nspecialized technicians eligible\nfor two year visas.  As of now\nthey're only allowed in Cuba for\nsix months at a time.  In short,\nwe're in a full partnership with\nthe Cuban Government.\n\nVIEW ON MICHAEL\n\nis handed a piece of cake.  Roth moves over to a folder of\ndocuments.\n\nROTH\n(continuing)\n\nHere are applications from Friends\nall over the States.  I understand\nSanto Virgilio in Tampa is trying\nto make his own deal.  Well, the\nCuban Government will brush him off.\nThe Lakeville Road Boys are going\nto take over the Nacionale here.\nI'm planning a new hotel casino to\nbe known as Riviera.  The new Capri\nwill go to the Corleone Family.\n\nMED. VIEW\n\nThe cake is sliced and carried to each of the men.\n\nROTH\nThen there's the Sevilla Biltmore;\nthe Havana Hilton, which is going\nto cost twenty-four million --\nCuban banks will put up half, the\nTeamsters will bankroll the rest.\nGenerally, there will be friends\nfor all our friends including the\nLieutenant Governor of Nevada;\nEddie Levine of Newport will bring\nin the Pennino Brothers, Dino and\nEddie; they'll handle actual casino\noperations.\n\nAnd seeing that all of his friends have been served, Roth\nraises his fork.\n\nROTH\nEnjoy.\n\nMICHAEL\nI saw an interesting thing today.\nA man was being arrested by the\nMilitary Police; probably an urban\nguerrilla.  Rather than be taken\nalive, he exploded a grenade hidden\nin his jacket, taking the command\nvehicle with him.\n\nThe various men look up as Michael eats his cake, wondering\nwhat the point of it is.\n\nMICHAEL\nIt occurred to me: the police are\npaid to fight, and the Rebels are\nnot.\n\n\n\nSAM ROTH\nSo?\n\nMICHAEL\nSo, that occurred to me.\n\nVIEW ON ROTH\n\nHe understands Michael's point, if the others do not.\n\nROTH\nThis country has had rebels for the\nlast fifty years; it's part of\ntheir blood.  Believe me, I know...\nI've been coming here since the\ntwenties; we were running molasses\nout of Havana when you were a baby.\nTo trucks owned by your father.\n\n(he chuckles warmly\nover the memory)\n\nWe'll talk when we're alone.\n\nAnd he returns his attention to the men who are gathered\nwith him on his birthday.\n\nEXT. ROTH'S PRIVATE TERRACE - DAY\n\nMichael sits alone with the old man, on a terrace that\noverlooks the city.\n\nROTH\nYou have to be careful what you say\nin front of the others... they\nfrighten easy.  It's always been\nthat way, most men frighten easy.\n\nMICHAEL\nWe're making a big investment in\nCuba.  That's my only concern.\n\nROTH\nMy concern is that the three\nmillion never arrived at Batista's\nnumbered account in Switzerland.\nHe thinks it's because you have\nsecond thoughts about his ability\nto stop the rebels.\n\nMICHAEL\nThe money was sent.\n\nROTH\nThen you have to trace it.  Michael,\npeople here look at me as a reliable\nman.  I can't afford not to be\nlooked on as a reliable man.  But\nyou know all that; there's nothing\nyou can learn from me.  You\nshouldn't have to put up with a\nsick old man as a partner.\n\nMICHAEL\nI wouldn't consider anyone else.\n\nROTH\nExcept the President of the United\nStates.\n\n\n\nHe laughs slyly, as though this is some private joke between\nthem.  Then his laughter becomes a cough, which he painfully\nstifles with a handkerchief.\n\nROTH\nIf only I could live to see it,\nkid; to be there with you.  How\nbeautifully we've done it, step by\nstep.  Here, protected, free to\nmake our profits without the\nJustice Department, the FBI; ninety\nmiles away in partnership with a\nfriendly government.  Ninety miles,\njust a small step, looking for a\nman who desperately wants to be\nPresident of the United States, and\nhaving the cash to make it possible.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou'll be there to see it; you'll\nbe there.\n\nINT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - NIGHT\n\nThe telephone has just rung; Michael listens.\n\nOPERATOR\nWe have your call to Tahoe, Nevada,\nsir.\n\nMICHAEL\nThank you.\n\n(click, click)\nTom?  Tom, is that you?\n\nROCCO (O.S.)\nNo, Tom's out of town.  This is\nRocco.  Who is this?\n\nMichael is openly disturbed that Hagen is not there.  He\nhangs up without answering.\n\nEXT. NEW ENGLAND HOUSE - DAY\n\nTom Hagen steps out of a taxicab a bit tentatively, and then\nsteps toward the door of a pleasant New England house.  He\nrings the bell and waits, hat in hand.

Look.\n\nThe little boy, moodily by himself.\n\nVIEW ON KAY\n\nobviously moved.\n\nKAY\n\n\n\nHe's not like a little boy... he\ndoesn't talk to me; he doesn't want\nto play; he doesn't like other\nchildren, he doesn't like toys.\nIt's as though he's waiting for the\ntime he can take his Father's place.\n\n(almost in tears)\nYou know what he told me when he\nwas four years old.

He stops, knocks on the door of Roth's suite.\nThen quickly for a man his size, he moves without noise to\nthe adjoining door, opens it with a key, and disappears\ninside.\n\nA moment elapses on the empty corridor, and then a roused\nJohnny Ola, opens the first door.  He steps out into the\ncorridor, to see who had knocked.  Confused, he is about to\nreturn inside, when Bussetta easily breaks his neck in two\nfrom behind.\n\nINT. THE SUITE - MED. VIEW - NIGHT\n\nas Bussetta quietly pulls the limp body of Johnny Ola, his\nhead bent at an impossible angle, and lays it at the foot of\nthe couch.\n\nEXT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT\n\nGuards who are regular troops patrol the Palace in twos,\ncarrying machine weapons.\n\nNow an elite officer, checks the identification of the\nvarious cars carrying dignitaries, as they are driven up to\nthe Palace.  The one being inspected at the moment contains\nFredo and Michael.  We can see the beautifully dressed\npeople on their way to the reception, and sense the cheerful\nmood of this New Year's Eve.\n\nINT. THE SUITE - NIGHT\n\nBussetta bends over Ola's body, tying the wrists and knees\nwith electrical extensions.  He then easily carries the body\nto the small balcony which all the rooms have.\n\nEXT. THE BALCONY - NIGHT\n\nBussetta swings the body over the side of the balcony\nrailing; tying the extension cord to the railing, and\nsuspending the body so that it is invisible both from the\ninside and out during the night.\n\nINT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - VIEW ON THE MAIN FOYER - NIGHT\n\nThe PRESIDENT, his WIFE and six oldest CHILDREN great\nformally the many beautifully and affluently dressed guests.\nHe speaks to them in Spanish, as one by one they file to him.\n\nMichael and Fredo are presented in a group with several\nother Americans, including several of the American\nbusinessmen with interests in Cuba.\n\nEXT.

THE SUITE - NIGHT\n\nBussetta delicately picks up a small satin cushion that had\nfallen from the couch, and replaces it as though nothing had\nhappened.  Slowly he cracks the door open which adjoins\nRoth's bedroom.  There is a slight commotion; whispered\nvoices.\n\nBUSSETTA'S VIEW\n\nTerri, Mrs. Roth, is crying.  A group of men lift Hyman\nRoth's frail body onto a stretcher.\n\nCLOSE ON BUSSETTA\n\nrealizes that this is the man he is to kill.\n\nCLOSER VIEW ON ROTH\n\nHe is alive; breathing hard with his mouth dry and open.\nThe doctor examines him, and then gives instructions to the\norderly who carries him out, presumably to the ambulance.\n\nBussetta closes the door on this VIEW.\n\nINT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT\n\nAn orchestra plays for the guests, as an army of waiters\nserve champagne and hors d'oeuvres.  Michael relaxes with\nSenator Geary, Major Leon, and several of the Americans.\n\nQUESTADT\nThe embargo on arms shipments from\nthe U.S. to your government, was\njust a necessary public relations\nmove... Only last month, your air\nforce received a major shipment of\nrockets...\n\nMichael glances at his watch; Fredo concentrates on this.\n\nSENATOR GEARY\nWe believe in non-intervention...\nbut the agreement stipulates that\nour forces may be withdrawn... but\nas you've seen, we have not\nwithdrawn them.\n\nCORNGOLD\nAnd my guess is that President\nEisenhower won't pull out while we\nhave over three billion invested\nover here.\n\nMICHAEL\nFredo.

Michael notices it as well.\n\nINT. THE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - FULL VIEW - NIGHT\n\nThe activity at the end of the hall has come to rest; we can\ntell that the doctor tells Mrs. Roth that she should go, the\nold man will be taken to a room where he can rest.\nGradually, these people leave him in the care of the hospital\nstaff.\n\nBussetta watches from the distance of the hallway; after the\nold man has been moved, he quietly walks down the hallway to\nthe room.\n\nHIS VIEW\n\nA nurse sits in the room in attendance; Hyman Roth is\nasleep, his mouth wide open, breathing noisily.\n\nVIEW ON BUSSETTA\n\nhears footsteps, quickly steps away from the door, and into\nanother room.\n\nSome nurses and attendants speak to the nurse in the room in\nSpanish; one has brought a small bottle of wine, and\nobviously they are inviting the nurse to have a New Year's\ntoast with them.  They laugh; and the nurse steps away from\nthe room for a moment.\n\nBussetta moves slowly back into the room, alone with the\nhelpless Roth.\n\nINT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - FULL VIEW ON THE GUESTS - NIGHT\n\nseeing in the New Year; a great banner is hoisted up in\nSpanish, welcoming 1959.\n\nHands are shaken; kisses exchanged.\n\nMED.

Try not\nto make a big thing of it.\n\nHe kisses his brother once again.\n\nMICHAEL\n(Sicilian)\n\nI know it was you, Fredo.  You've\nbroken my heart.\n\nSlowly, understanding, Fredo backs away from his brother,\ntaking the kiss another way.\n\nA little distance away, Major Leon notices an old woman, one\nof the President's maids, moving across the alcove, carrying\nher suitcases.\n\nLEON\nWhat a pity; she's crying.  Must\nhave been fired, and she's been\nwith the President's family for\ntwenty years.\n\nEXT. HAVANA STREETS - NIGHT\n\nThe gathered crowd joyously welcomes the New Year.  We\nnotice the continual military movement.\n\nMED. VIEW\n\nA family surreptitiously leaves their home, carrying\nsuitcases and belongings.\n\nINT. ROTH'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT\n\nBussetta raises a hospital pillow, and easily begins to\nsmother the thin old man, who can barely struggle.\n\nOUT IN THE HALL\n\nA detachment of military move quickly, accompanied by some\nof Roth's men, as though they have important news that must\nbe dealt with.\n\nThey pass the small group of aides and nurses welcoming the\nNew Year.\n\nSeeing them, the nurse assigned to him, puts down her glass\nand moves quickly to the room.\n\nShe opens the door, and lays bare the sight of Bussetta\nsmothering Roth.  Bussetta turns quickly; and one of the\nmilitary takes out his pistol and shoots several times at\nhis head.\n\nINT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT\n\nThe entire reception has been disrupted for an announcement;\nall the guests in their formal dress and evening gowns,\nstanding with frightened faces like first class passengers\non a doomed ship.  The President himself, his back to our\nVIEW, is making an announcement in Spanish.  While he\nspeaks, we notice continuous movement of his personal staff,\ncarrying suitcases and possessions.\n\nPRESIDENT\n\n\n\n...Because of serious setbacks of\nour troops in Guantanamo and\nSantiago, we feel reluctantly, that\nwe must leave the Capital at once.\nMyself and my family must bid you\ngoodbye, and good fortune.  We will\ngo directly to Ciudad Trujillo.\n\nThe crowd is stunned; already whispers are moving throughout\nthe guests.\n\nThe only one who is not completely taken off guard is\nMichael, who quietly steps back, and disappears from the room.\n\nPRESIDENT\n...My only regret is that there\ncould not have been more warning...\nAs my last official act as\nPresident, I hereby appoint a\nprovisional government with Dr.\nCarlos M. Piedra, as its President.\n\nBy now, there is only one thought among the guests: how can\nthey get out, and with what.\n\nEXT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT\n\nWe see evidence of the confusion at this late hour; already\ncars are beginning to move; people leaving the Palace in\nhaste.  Michael moves quickly toward his car.  He sees\nFredo, watching him in fear.\n\nMICHAEL\nCome with me.  It's your only way\nof getting out!\n\nVIEW ON FREDO\n\nTerrified of his brother, and what he knows; Fredo backs\naway into the growing noise and confusion of the crowd.\n\nVIEW ON MICHAEL\n\nFinally, he has to step into the car and it roars off.\n\nEXT.

THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY - MED. VIEW - NIGHT\n\nCrowds of panicked and frightened tourists, and Batistianos\nare trying to get to the safety of the Embassy with the\nfamilies and possessions.\n\nWe see Geary, and some of the Americans we had met, working\ntheir way through the crowds, shouting that they are\nAmericans in order to get preference on the line.  Often\n\n\n\nthat declaration brings 'boos' from the crowds.\n\nSometimes the joyous Cubans will let a family through, but\nagain, taking away the suitcases, rich leather, filled with\nmoney and valuables.  Money seems to be stuffed everywhere.\n\nEXT. THE YACHT CLUB - NIGHT\n\nAll forms of private transportation are jammed with people\ntrying to get out, holding cash in their hands for anyone\nwith a yacht or small boat to get them to Florida.\n\nA car pulls up; and we see Sam Roth, Terri Roth and some of\ntheir men, carry the sickly, but still alive Hyman Roth to a\nprivate cruiser which is protected by men with machine guns.\n\nWithin seconds, they are on their way to Miami.\n\nEXT. THE PRIVATE AIRPORT - NIGHT\n\nThings are no different at the airport; where anything that\ncan fly is being jammed with refugees and their money.\n\nA wealthy family is arguing with the pilot of a fast\nairplane; trying to force cash on him, and his family into\nthe plane.  The PILOT steadfastly refuses, although checking\nhis watch, as though his passengers are late.  He speaks\nonly English.\n\nPILOT\nNo, this is a private plane.  No,\nthis plane is taken.\n\nFinally Michael's Mercury pulls up, and Michael approaches\nthe Pilot.\n\nMICHAEL\nHe isn't here.\n\nPILOT\nWe've got to leave, they'll take\nthis thing apart.\n\nMICHAEL\nAll right.  Go now.\n\nThe Pilot lets Michael in, as the Cuban screams curses at\nthem, and begins searching for another plane for his family.\n\nINT.

It is my pleasure to make\nthis a gift.\n\nCLOSE VIEW ON VITO\n\nVITO\nYou are kind.  If ever I can do\nsomething for you, in return,\nplease come to me.\n\nINT. VITO'S TENEMENT - DAY\n\nDespite his new position of 'respect,' there is little\nchanged about his home.  Only that they have lived there a\nwhile now, and the rooms are fuller with the inevitable\npossessions a young family acquires.\n\nHe kisses his wife, who seems a big apprehensive.  He shows\nher the fruit; and from her reaction knows she has something\non her mind.\n\nVITO\n(Sicilian)\n\nWhat is it?\n\nCARMELLA\n(Sicilian)\n\nCome...\n\nThey step into the tiny parlor, where we see an older woman,\nwaiting nervously.\n\nCARMELLA\nThe Signora is a friend of mine.\nShe has a favor to ask of you.\n\nVITO\n(Sicilian)\n\nWhy do you come to me?\n\nSIGNORA COLOMBO\n(Sicilian)\n\nShe told me to ask you.\n\nHe seems surprised; looks to his wife.\n\nCARMELLA\nShe is having some trouble.  Her\nlandlord has received complaints\nbecause of her dog.  He told her to\nget rid of it, but her boy loved\nit, so they tried to hide it.  When\nthe landlord found out, he was so\nangry, he ordered her to leave.\nEven if she truly will let the dog\ngo.\n\nSIGNORA COLOMBO\n(Sicilian)\n\nHe said he would have the police\nput us out.\n\nVITO\n(thoughtfully)\n\nI can give you some money to help\nyou move, is that what you want?\n\nSIGNORA COLOMBO\nMy friends are all here; how can I\n\n\n\nmove to another neighborhood with\nstrangers?  I want you to speak to\nthe landlord to let me stay.\n\nVito nods to the frightened old woman.\n\nVITO\nIt's done then.  You won't have to\nmove; I'll speak to him tomorrow\nmorning.\n\nCarmella breaks into a smile; which her husband des not\nacknowledge.\n\nThe old woman starts to leave the room; but she is not\nconvinced.\n\nSIGNORA COLOMBO\nYou're sure he'll say yes, the\nlandlord?\n\nVITO\nI'm sure he's a good-hearted fellow.\nOnce I explain how things are with\nyou, I'm sure he'll take pity on\nyour misfortunes.  Don't let it\ntrouble you any more.\n\n(as he shows her out)\nGuard your health, for the sake of\nyour children.\n\nEXT. TENEMENT BLOCK - DAY\n\nSIGNOR ROBERTO, a pompous, rather well-dressed Patrone\nangrily walks down the steps of one of his tenement buildings.\n\nHe carries a check list, and makes marks with a pencil\nconcerning the condition of his various buildings; a broken\nwindow here, some missing tile there.  He bends over to pick\nup some garbage left by a thoughtless tenant, muttering to\nhimself, when he sees the shoes and legs of a young worker.\n\nVITO (O.S.)\nSignore Roberto...\n\nHe rises to be face to face with a polite Vito Corleone.\n\nVITO\nThe friend of my wife, a poor widow\nwith no man to protect her, tells\nme that for some reason she has\nbeen ordered to move from your\nbuilding.  She is in despair.  She\nhas no money, she has no friends\nexcept those that live here.\n\nSignor Roberto brusquely answers, and continues on his way.\n\nROBERTO\nI have already rented the apartment\nto another family.\n\nMOVING SHOT ON THE TWO\n\nVITO\nI told her I would speak to you,\nthat you are a reasonable man who\nacted out of some misunderstanding.\nShe has gotten rid of the animal\n\n\n\nthat caused all the trouble, so why\nshouldn't she stay.  As one Italian\nto another, I ask you the favor.\n\nROBERTO\nI've already rented it; I cannot\ndisappoint the new tenants.  They're\npaying a higher rent.\n\nVITO\nHow much more a month?\n\nROBERTO\nEh...\n\n(we sense he is lying)\nFive dollars more.\n\nVito reaches into his pocket, and takes out a roll of bills.\n\nVITO\nHere is the six month's increase in\nadvance.  You needn't speak to her\nabout it, she's a proud woman.  See\nme again in another six months.\nBut of course, you'll let her keep\nher dog.\n\nROBERTO\nLike hell!  And who the hell are\nyou to give me orders.  Watch your\nmanners or you'll be on your\nSicilian ass in the street there.\n\nVito raises his hands in surprise; his voice is reasonable.\n\nVITO\nI'm asking you a favor, only that.\nOne never knows when one might need\na friend, isn't that true?  Here,\ntake this money as a sign of my\ngood-will, and make your own\ndecision.  I won't quarrel with it.\n\n(he puts the money in\nRoberto's hand)\n\nDo me this little favor, just take\nit and think carefully.  Tomorrow\nmorning if you want to give me the\nmoney back, by all means do so.  If\nyou want the woman out of your\nhouse, how can I stop you?  It's\nyour property, after all.  If you\ndon't want the dog in there, I can\nunderstand.  I dislike dogs myself.\n\n(he pats Roberto on\nthe shoulder)\n\nDo me this service, eh?  I won't\nforget it.  Ask your friends in\nthis neighborhood about me, they'll\ntell you I'm a man who believes in\nshowing his gratitude.\n\nWithout a word more, Vito leaves a hypnotized Roberto\nstanding in front of the tenement, his hand clasping the\nmoney.\n\nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY\n\nA thin young man, almost gawky, walks down the street in\nthis Italian neighborhood, his name is HYMAN SUCHOWSKY.\n\n\n\nHe carries his tools as he comes home from work.  He is\npursued and tormented by a couple of Italian youths, about\nhis own age, eighteen.\n\nITALIAN BOY\nKid, where do you live?\n\nANOTHER\nWhere'd you get those nigger lips?\n\nHe tries not to be intimidated; finally one of the boys,\nsteps in front of him and stops him.\n\nITALIAN BOY\nSay 'bread' in Italian.\n\nANOTHER\nHe dunno.\n\nITALIAN BOY\nGo on; how do you say 'bread' in\nItalian?  If you're from the\nneighborhood, you should know how\nto say 'bread' in Italian.\n\nAn amused Peter Clemenza steps forward from a local coffee\nhouse, to preside over the fuss.  He's a 'big' man in the\nneighborhood, and loves a fight.\n\nCLEMENZA\nWhat's up?\n\nITALIAN BOY\nThis kid lives around here, but he\ncan't say bread in Italian.\n\nCLEMENZA\nThat's 'cause he's Jew.  Look at\nthose pregnant lips!\n\nHe giggles at his own joke.\n\nITALIAN BOY\nAre you a Jewboy?\n\nThe boy doesn't answer, tries to keep going.\n\nITALIAN BOY\nWell, if you're not a Jew, say\n'bread' in Italian.  See, he can't.\n\nAnd with that, he rounds a blow squarely to the boy's face,\nsending him sprawling to the cement, his tools flying with a\nclatter.\n\nThe other Italian immediately joins in with a few kicks to\nthe boy's stomach.  Hyman tries to fight back; grabs a hold\nof his tormentor's foot, and brings him down on the cement\nas well.  For a moment, they are rolling around on the\nsidewalk, two against one, Hyman taking the worst of it.\n\nCLEMENZA\nAlright, alright, cut it out.\n\nSECOND ITALIAN\nWhat for?  He killed Jesus Christ!\n\nClemenza pulls him off, and kicks him in the ass.\n\n\n\nCLEMENZA\nI said cut it out!\n\n(to the beaten kid)\nWhat's your name?\n\nHYMAN\nHyman Suchowsky.\n\nITALIAN BOY\nI don't believe it.  In our\nneighborhood, with a name like that!\n\nCLEMENZA\nWhat are those tools?  You work on\ncars?\n\nHYMAN\nYeah.\n\nCLEMENZA\nMaybe I know how you can make a\ncouple of extra bucks working as a\nmechanic.\n\nThe boy seems agreeable.\n\nCLEMENZA\nBut you gotta know how to keep your\nmouth shut, and fer Chrissakes, get\nrid of that name.  I'll call you\nJohnny Lips.\n\n(he giggles at his\nown humor again)\n\nCome on...\n\nHe leads the boy down the street, whispering to him, on the\nside:\n\nCLEMENZA\nBread in Italian is pane.  P-A-N-E,\npane.  Don't forget.\n\nINT. NEW GENCO WAREHOUSE - DAY\n\nA newly acquired warehouse, stocked with cases of the new\nproduct \"GENCO PURA\" olive oil.  It is the beginning of a\nnew business, in the American tradition.  Now they have one\nrattling old truck, and a few stock boys.\n\nGenco has become the accountant-business manager, based on\nthe experience working with his father.  But it is clear,\nthat Vito is the leader, and undisputed 'President' of the\nnew enterprise.\n\nGenco moves through the darkness of the warehouse, to the\nsmall divided area that Vito uses as his office.\n\nGENCO\n(Sicilian)\n\nThe 'patrone' is here.\n\nVITO\nChi?\n\nGENCO\nRoberto.  Who owns the 'rat-holes.'\n\nVito nods that he will see him; and soon Roberto enters, on\n\n\n\ntiptoe, his hat in his hand, and in a apologetic voice.\n\nROBERTO\nExcuse me, I hope I am not a\ndisturbance, Don Corleone.\n\nVITO\nYes.\n\nROBERTO\nWhat a terrible misunderstanding.\nOf course, Signora Colombo can stay\nin the flat.  Who were those\nmiserable tenants to complain about\nnoise from a poor animal...when\nthey pay such low rent.\n\nThen abruptly, he puts the roll of money on Vito's table,\nand steps back a respectful distance.\n\nROBERTO\nYour good heart in helping the poor\nwidow has shamed me, and I want to\nshow that I, too, have some\nChristian charity.  Her rent will\nremain what it was.\n\nVITO\nWhat was that?\n\nROBERTO\nIn fact, reduced, bu five dollars!\n\nVito embraces him warmly.\n\nVITO\nI accept your generosity...\n\nROBERTO\nI won't keep you another minute...\n\nHe quickly takes his leave, bowing several times, and then\nmakes it back to the safety of the warehouse; he sighs,\ndeflates his lungs, and mops his brow; his bones have turned\ntoo jelly with fear at his narrow escape.  He all but runs\nout of the warehouse.\n\nGenco laughs as he watches.\n\nGENCO\nWe won't see him for weeks!  He'll\nstay in bed in the Bronx!\n\nClemenza has been waiting with his new mechanic.  We notice\nthe subtle difference in the way he treats Vito.  He is no\nlonger a junior apprentice in their petty crimes; but an\nimposing leader.\n\nCLEMENZA\nThis kid is good with cars; he\nkiijed at the truck, and says he\ncan keep it going.\n\nVito looks over the lanky young man.\n\nCLEMENZA\nWhat's your name?\n\nHYMAN\n\n\n\nSuchowsky.  Hyman Suchowsky.\n\nCLEMENZA\nHe's gonna dump that; I call him\nJohnny Lips.\n\nVITO\nWho is the greatest man you can\nthink of?\n\nCLEMENZA\nGo on, answer him when he talks to\nyou.  Tell him: Columbus, Marconi...\nGaribaldi.\n\nHYMAN\nArnold Rothstein.\n\nVITO\nThen take that as your name: Hyman\nRothstein.\n\nGenco is out in the alley; he calls out with glee.\n\nGENCO\nVitone!  Look at this!\n\nVito moves out to the smiling Genco; Clemenza and the newly\nchristened Hyman Rothstein follow a distance behind.\n\nEXT.

The\nAmerican Embassy arranged flights\nfor citizens; I'm not sure, but I\nthink he's somewhere in New York.\n\nMICHAEL\nI want you to reach Fredo.  I know\nhe's scared, but have one of our\npeople reach him.  Assure him that\nthere will be no reprisals.  Tell\nhim that I know Roth misled him.\n\nHAGEN\nMy information is that Fredo\nthought it was a kidnapping.  Roth\nassured him nothing would happen to\nyou.\n\nMICHAEL\n(indicating Rocco and\nNeri on the balcony)\n\nThey can come in now.\n\nHAGEN\nWait... there's something else.\n\nMICHAEL\nAlright.\n\nHagen pauses; doesn't know how to begin.\n\nMICHAEL\n(impatiently)\n\nGo on, tell me.\n\nHAGEN\nKay had a miscarriage; she lost the\nbaby.\n\nAfter a moment:\n\nMICHAEL\nWas it a boy or a girl?\n\nHAGEN\nMike, at three and a half...\n\nMICHAEL\nWhat is it, can't you give me\nstraight answers anymore!\n\nHAGEN\nIt was a boy.\n\nMICHAEL\nAnd Kay...she's all right?\n\nHAGEN\n\n\n\nShe took the Senate Investigation\nworse.\n\nMICHAEL\nDoes she blame it on me?  The baby?\n\nHAGEN\nI don't know.\n\nEXT. TAHOE ESTATE - DAY\n\nThe first snow of the New Year has fallen; the trees are\nbare, and there is hush all over this part of the Sierras.\nMichael is driven in his car, looking out at the familiar\nsight of the home he has been forced to be away from.\n\nVIEW ON MICHAEL\n\nlooking out from his window.  The last time he had seen the\nestate it was warm, and the trees were full.\n\nMOVING VIEW\n\napproaching the great stone gates; closed.  The bodyguards\nare not readily visible, but they are there.  The iron gates\nare opened, and one of the men makes a simple nod of respect,\nas the car pulls in.\n\nNEW VIEW\n\nInside the estate, the private roads have been freshly\nplowed, and occasionally a worker will pause to watch the\ncar as it passes.\n\nThe Grandchildren are in school now, and so the estate is\nespecially quiet.  Although there are signs that children\nlive here; a bicycle, a sled, a swing and gymnastic set, wet\nand with a rim of snow still on it.\n\nINT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - VIEW FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE - DAY\n\nto the outside, where Michael walks slowly.  He stops and\nlooks at a little Italian red sportscar made for children.\n\nNEW VIEW\n\nThe front door opens, and Michael enters his own home.  It\nis very quiet, no one is at home to greet him.  He can see\nthe evidence of his family; things his wife and his children\nhave been using, and left on a sofa or a table.\n\nHe moves toward his and Kay's bedroom, where we can HEAR the\nSOUND of a sewing machine running.\n\nQuietly he opens the door.\n\nMICHAEL'S VIEW\n\ninto the bedroom.  Kay is sitting by the window, lit by the\ncold afternoon light, at work with her sewing machine.  She\nhasn't noticed that he's in the room yet, and goes on with\nher work.\n\nVIEW ON MICHAEL\n\nstands there a moment, watching, not making a sound.  And\nthen without a word, he steps back, and closes the door, so\nthat she doesn't see him.\n\n\n\nVIEW FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE\n\nonto Michael, moving outside, walking through the snow, he\nmoves to the house next to his own.\n\nINT. CONNIE'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nThis is the house where Mama lives with Connie's children,\nConnie so rarely is there.\n\nHe steps in; his mother is asleep in a chair in the living\nroom.  He moves to her, and bends low, whispers.\n\nMICHAEL\nMom... Mom...\n\nShe opens her eyes, which are red and small with age.\n\nMICHAEL\n(Sicilian)\n\nIt's Michael.  How are you, Mom?\n\nMAMA\n(Sicilian)\n\nI'm alright.  Will you stay home\nfor awhile?\n\nMICHAEL\n(Sicilian)\n\nThere are still things I have to do.\n\nMAMA\n(Sicilian)\n\nWell, we can all have a nice dinner\ntogether tonight.  How are your eyes?\n\nMICHAEL\nAlright.  They bother me once in\nawhile.\n\n(a pause as he thinks)\nTell me, when Pop had troubles...\ndid he ever think, even to himself,\nthat he had gone the wrong way;\nthat maybe by trying to be strong\nand trying to protect his family,\nthat he could... that he could...\nlose it instead?\n\nMAMA\n(Sicilian)\n\nYou talk about the baby.  She can\nhave another baby.\n\nMICHAEL\n(Sicilian)\n\nNo, I meant lose his family.\n\nMAMA\n(as best she ever\nunderstood it)\n\nYour family?  How can you ever lose\nyour family?\n\nMICHAEL\n(almost to himself)\n\nBut times are different...\n\nFULL VIEW IN ROOM - MICHAEL AND HIS MOTHER\n\n\n\nQuietly we HEAR the music of a small band playing an Italian\nmarch.  From the orchestration, we know it is from the past.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT. TRAIN STATION AT CORLEONE - DAY\n\nVitone and his young family: Mama, Santino, Fredo and the\nbaby Michael are met at the small station in Sicily by\nfriends, and Mama's relatives.  There is a small band,\nplaying for the occasion.  A small man has brought a motor\ncar to pick the family up; and there are certain dark men,\nwith shotguns slung over their shoulders to preside over the\noccasion.\n\nThe family is helped into the car; the luggage is packed on\nthe roof, and the car drives off.  The second car, with\nbodyguards following.\n\nEXT. DON TOMASINO'S VILLA OUTSIDE OF CORLEONE - DAY\n\nThe villa is bloomed with flowers and DON TOMASINO at this\npoint is a man in his late twenties.  He embraces Vitone and\npats the heads of his children, and leads them all into the\ngarden.\n\nINT. THE VILLA - SUMPTUOUS MED. VIEW - LATE DAY\n\nA sumptuous table is set for the visiting family from\nAmerica.  There is a warm atmosphere as Vito, his wife and\nchildren eat.  Tomasino and his family received presents\nfrom Carmella and to Tomasino's mother, and gifts are given\nto all of the children.\n\nAll typically American representing some of the prosperity\nand interests in the consumer goods that followed a great war.\n\nEXT. CORLEONE PLAZA - DAY\n\nThe family exits the church on the plaza of the town.  Vito\nshakes hands warmly with the priest.\n\nINT. VILLAGE COTTAGE - NIGHT\n\nThe door is open -- the footsteps of a man enter the room.\nWe follow these footsteps without quite knowing to whom they\nbelong.  They lead us to a bed, where we see asleep an OLD\nMAN.  He sleeps in his undershirt and is sweating, covered\nby mosquito netting.\n\nVIEW ALTERS\n\nand we realize that it is young Vito looking at the MAN.\n\nWe remember that the man is MOSCA, one of three men, who\nalmost twenty years before had hunted down Vito when he was\na boy.  With lightning speed, Vito slashes through the\nmosquito netting with a knife.  And with the movement\nprecise as a butcher's he disembowls this man.\n\nEXT. OLIVE OIL WAREHOUSE - FULL VIEW\n\nVito has brought his wife and children to see the Olive Oil\nDepot which is the link to his New York importing business.\nThey go inside.\n\nINT. OLIVE OIL WAREHOUSE - DAY\n\nThey are led by one of Vito's associates through rows and\n\n\n\nrows of large vats of olive oil.  Vito very proudly shows\nhis associates in Italy the olive oil can that will be used\nin the United States.  They all stand around at the link to\ntheir new importing business and share a toast of wine.\n\nEXT. THE BAY - DAY\n\nA team of Sicilian fisherman are at work mending their nets.\nOne sings accompanied by a guitar.\n\nVIEW MOVES TO ONE OF THE OLD FISHERMAN\n\nHe is recognized as the second of the men who had hunted\nVito down.  STROLLO.  As he walks we notice there is a\nfigure that is moving through the drying sails and barrels,\nit is Vito.  He moves quietly, stepping up behind the old\nman.  In an instant, he has thrown a garrote around his\nthroat, twisting it tight, so that there is very little\nsound.\n\nThen, almost silently dragging him through the space hidden\nby the drying sails.\n\nEXT. THE IMPRESSIVE ESTATE OF DON FRANCESCO - DAY\n\nWe see an old car approach.  Its driver is the young Tomasino.\nSitting in the car with him is Vito.\n\nThe car stops at the gates, and an old guard sees and\nrecognizes Tomasino, opens the gates allowing them to enter.\n\nMED. VIEW\n\non an almost decrepit DON FRANCESCO.  He must be in his\nearly nineties, sitting as powerful and as impressive as\never, in his throne-like chair from which he manages the\npower as the Mafia Chieftan of this village.  Young Don\nTomasino is speaking.\n\nWe notice in a little distance in the rear, there are some\nyounger shepherds with shotguns thrown over their shoulders.\n\nTOMASINO\n(Sicilian)\n\nDon Francesco, if you will honor\nme, by allowing me to introduce my\nassociate in America, in New York.\nHis name is Vito Corleone.\n\nThe old man and his eyes glance up at a notion of a man who\nhas taken the name of this town as his name.\n\nTOMASINO\nWe will supply him with olive oil\nexclusively in the town of Corleone.\nHis company is called the \"Genco\nOlive Oil Company.\" Here we have\nbrought you an indication of how he\nwill sell the product.\n\nTomasino respectfully puts a can of olive oil where the old\nman can look at it.  The old man nods, accepting the notion\nof this business.\n\nTOMASINO\n(Sicilian)\n\nWe have come to ask your blessing\nand permission to continue this\nenterprise.\n\n\n\nDON FRANCESCO\n(Sicilian)\n (in a shrill, high,\nraspy voice)\n\nWhere is this young man?\n\nTOMASINO\nHe is right here, standing next to\nme, Don Francesco.\n\nDON FRANCESCO\n(Sicilian)\n\nHave him come closer, I can't see\nvery well.\n\nVito takes those several steps, so that he is standing right\nin front of the old man.\n\nVIEW ON DON FRANCESCO\n\nlooking up, squinting against the sun.\n\nDON FRANCESCO'S VIEW\n\nStrangely backlit, almost blurry image of the young man from\nAmerica.\n\nDON FRANCESCO\n(Sicilian)\n\nWhat is your name?\n\nVITO\n(Sicilian)\n\nVito Corleone.\n\nDON FRANCESCO\n(Sicilian)\n\nYou took the name of this town, eh?\nWhat was your father's name?\n\nVITO\n(Sicilian)\n\nAntonio Andolini.\n\nCLOSE VIEW ON THE OLD MAN\n\nThe recognition of the name throws a shudder through him.\nIt is as though he recognizes that this is the boy; the son\nof his old enemy, whom he had killed, and whose sons he had\ntried to wipe out.  The old man raises his feeble hands\nsignalling his guard, and in his weak voice, he shouts:\n\nDON FRANCESCO\n(Sicilian)\n\nKill him!  Kill him!\n\nBut he is too late; Vito steps forward.\n\nVITO\n(Sicilian)\n\nIn the name of my Father, and my\nBrother...\n\nAnd uses the knife, ritualistically plunging it into the old\nman's belly, and then up to his throat, which is severed.\n\nVIEW ON TOMASINO\n\n\n\nhas drawn his pistol and quickly shoots one of the guards,\nhelping Vito to escape back into the motor car.\n\nVIEW ON A GUARD\n\nraising his shotgun.\n\nVIEW ON THE MOTOR CAR\n\nJust as Tomasino is about to get into the car, the shotgun\nis fired, and he is hit in the legs.\n\nVito manages to pull him up into the car, and they make\ntheir escape.\n\nEXT.

She holds up the baby Michael, and helps him\nwave his hand.\n\nINT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - MED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL - DAY\n\nSENATOR KANE (O.S.)\nAre you the son of Vito Corleone?\n\nMICHAEL\nYes.\n\nSENATOR KING\nDid he use at times an alias?  Was\nthis alias in certain circles\nGODFATHER?\n\nMICHAEL\nIt was not an alias.  GODFATHER was\na term of affection, used by his\nfriends, one of respect.\n\nSENATOR WEEKLER\n(Senator from New\nYork, very smooth,\npartly liberal,\nTammany Hall)\n\nLet me agree with that.  Many of my\nconstituents are Italian and have\nbeen honored with that certain\nfriendship by my close Italian\nfriends.  Up to this point before I\nhave to leave this hearing to join\nmy own committee, let me say, that\nthis hearing on the Mafia is in no\nway a slur on the Italians by the\nSenate; nor is it meant to be; nor\nwill I allow it to be.  Italian\n\n\n\nAmericans are the hardest working,\nmost law abiding patriotic Americans\nof our country.  It is a shame and\na pity that a few rotten apples\ngive them a bad name.  We are here\nto weed those rotten apples out of\nthe vast healthy barrel of Italian\nAmericans, who are one of the\nbackbones of our country.\n\nThere is a pause for a while, while the New York Senator\nposes for the TV cameras and leaves the hearing so that he\nwill not be associated with hearing the rough stuff.\n\nSENATOR KANE\nI'm sure we all agree with our\nesteemed colleague.  Now, Mr.\nCorleone, you have been advised as\nto your legal rights.  We have had\ntestimony from a preceding witness\nwho states you are head of the most\npowerful Mafia family in this\ncountry.  Are you?\n\nMICHAEL\nNo.\n\nSENATOR KANE\nThis witness has testified that you\nare personally responsible for the\nmurder of a New York Police Captain\nin the year 1947 and with him a man\nnamed Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny\nthis?\n\nMICHAEL\nI deny his every charge.\n\nSENATOR KANE\nIs it true that in the year 1950\nyou devised the murder of the heads\nof the Five Families in New York,\nto assume and consolidate your\nnefarious power?\n\nMICHAEL\nThat is a complete falsehood.\n\nSENATOR KANE\nIs it true that you own a\ncontrolling interest in three of\nthe major hotels in Las Vegas?\n\nMICHAEL\nThat is not true.  I own some stock\nin some of the hotels, but only\nvery small amounts.  I also own\nsome American Telephone and IBM\nstock.\n\nMichael had checked this point with Hagen, before answering,\nand then once again after the answer.\n\nSENATOR ROGERS\nWhy is it necessary for your\ncounsel to advise you on that\nquestion?\n\nMICHAEL\n\n\n\nSenator, I've observed the head of\nGeneral Motors before a Senate\nCommittee, and his lawyer whispered\nin his ear.  That was not commented\nupon in the way you have just done.\n\nSENATOR KANE\nMr. Corleone, do you have any hotel\ninterests in the state of Arizona?\nOr any gambling interests in that\nstate?\n\nMICHAEL\nI do not.\n\nSENATOR KANE\nDo you have interests or control\nover gambling and narcotics in the\nstate of New York.\n\nMICHAEL\nI do not.\n\nA pause.  Silence, as the Chairman whispers something to his\nassistant.\n\nTom Hagen takes a paper out of his briefcase, and addresses\nthe Chair.\n\nHAGEN\nSenator, my client would like to\nread a statement for the record.\n\nSENATOR KANE\nI don't think that's necessary.\n\nHAGEN\nSir, my client has answered every\nquestion asked by this committee\nwith the utmost cooperation and\nsincerity.  He has not taken that\nFifth Amendment as it was his right\nto do, and which because of the\nextreme legal complexity of this\nhearing, counsel advised him to do.\nSo, I think in all fairness this\ncommittee should hear his statement\nand put it in the record.\n\nSENATOR KANE\nVery well.\n\nAt this point Senator Rogers contemptuously walks out of the\nhearing room.\n\nMICHAEL\n(reading)\n\nIn the hopes of clearing my family\nname, in the sincere desire to give\nmy children their fair share of the\nAmerican way of life without a\nblemish on their name and background\nI have appeared before this\ncommittee and given it all the\ncooperation in my power.  I consider\nmy being called before this\ncommittee an act of prejudice to\nall Americans of Italian extraction.\nI consider it a great dishonor to\n\n\n\nme personally to have to deny that\nI am a criminal.  I wish to have\nthe following noted for the record.\nThat I served my country faithfully\nand honorably in World War II and\nwas awarded the Distinguished\nService Cross for actions in\ndefense of my country.  That I have\nnever been arrested or indicted for\nany crime whatsoever... that no\nproof linking me to any criminal\nconspiracy, whether it is called\nMafia or Cosa Nostra or whatever\nother name you wish to give, has\never been made public.  Only one\nman has made charges against me,\nand that man is known to be a\nmurderer, arsonist and rapist.  And\nyet this committee had used this\nperson to besmirch my name.  My\npersonal protest can only be made\nto the people of this country.  I\ncan only thank God that in this\ncountry we have a legal system and\ncourts of law to protect innocent\npeople from wild accusation.  I\nthank God for our democratic due\nprocess of Law that shields me from\nthe false charges made by this\ncommittee's witness.  I have not\ntaken refuge behind the Fifth\nAmendment, though counsel advised\nme to do so.  I challenge this\ncommittee to produce any witness or\nevidence against me, and if they do\nnot, I hope they will have the\ndecency to clear my name with the\nsame publicity with which they have\nnow besmirched it.  I ask this\nwithout malice, in the interests of\nfair play.\n\nThe television cameras have documented this moment, as Hagen\nhands the document over to the committee lawyer.\n\nSENATOR ROGERS\nWe are all impressed.  The committee\nwill now recess over the weekend.\nHowever, it will continue Monday\nmorning, at eleven a.m.  At that\ntime, this committee will then\nproduce a witness directly linking\nMr. Corleone to the charges we have\nmade.  And then, Mr. Corleone may\nvery well by liable for indictments\nof perjury.  However, this document\nwill be made a matter of record.\n\nEXT. ARMY POST - DAY\n\nAn army post somewhere in the East.  It is safely guarded.\n\nINT. HOUSE ON THE POST - DAY\n\nwhere Pentangeli is being held by his constant companions,\nthe two FBI MEN.\n\nPENTANGELI\nTen to one shot, you said.  Ten to\n\n\n\none shot in my favor, and I lose.\n\nFBI MAN #1\nGet a good night's sleep.  We got a\nnew suit, new shirt, new tie, and\nI'm going to shave you myself.\nTomorrow we want you to look\nrespectable for fifty million of\nyour fellow Americans.\n\nPENTANGELI\nMy life won't be worth a nickel\nafter tomorrow.\n\nFBI MAN #1\nWe have a special home for you for\nthe rest of your life.  Nobody gets\nnear you.  You're not going any\nplace.\n\nPENTANGELI\nYeah, some deal I made.\n\nFBI MAN #2\nYou live like a king.  You'll be a\nhero.  You'll live better in here\nthan most people on the outside.\n\nPENTANGELI\nSome deal.\n\n(pause)\nI just wish Mike had took the Fifth.\n\nFBI MAN #1\nWhy'd you do it, Frankie?  After\nall these years, why'd you turn\nagainst him?\n\nPENTANGELI\nI didn't turn against nobody; he\nturned against me.\n\nEXT. THE BOATHOUSE ALCOVE - DAY\n\nA somewhat frightened Fredo Corleone sits in the easy chair\noverlooking the lake in this canopied section of the\nboathouse.  Rocco sits with him.\n\nINT. BOATHOUSE - DAY\n\nMichael is in the dark room with Hagen and Neri.\n\nMICHAEL\nHow did they get their hands on\nPentangeli?\n\nHAGEN\nRoth engineered it, Michael.  He\nmade Pentangeli think you hit him.\nDeliberately letting him get off\nalive.  Then the New York detectives\nturned Frankie over to the FBI.  My\ninformants say he was half dead and\nscared stiff -- talking out loud\nthat you had turned on him and\ntried to kill him.  Anyway, they\nhad him on possession, dealing in\nheroin, murder one and a lot more.\nThere's no way we can get to him\n\n\n\nand you've opened yourself to five\npoints of perjury.\n\nNERI\nThey've got him airtight.  He's in\na military base, twenty-four hour\nguards.  Trying to kill him is like\ntrying to like the President --\nit's impossible.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhat does Fredo know?\n\nHAGEN\nHe says he doesn't know anything,\nand I believe him.  Roth played\nthis one beautifully.\n\nMICHAEL\nAlright.  I'm going to go outside\nand talk to Fredo.\n\nEXT. BOATHOUSE FOYER - DAY\n\nFredo sits on the couch.  When Rocco sees Michael, he\nautomatically takes his leave.  Michael sits in the chair\nopposite Fredo.\n\nFREDO\n(after a pause)\n\nI don't have a lot to say, Michael.\n\nMICHAEL\nWe have time.\n\nFREDO\nI was kept pretty much in the dark.\nI didn't know all that much.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhat about now, is there anything\nyou can help me out with?\n\nFREDO\nI know they get Pentangeli, that's\nall I know.\n\nFredo gets up, walks to the glass panel that separates the\nterrace from the lake.\n\nFREDO\nI didn't know it was a hit.  I\nswear to you I didn't know.  Johnny\nOla contacted me in Beverly Hills --\nsaid he wanted to talk.  He said\nyou and Roth were in on some big\ndeal, and there was a place for me\nin it if I could help them out.\nThey said you were being tough on\nthe negotiation, and if they had a\nlittle bit of help, they could\nclose it fast and it would be good\nfor you.\n\nMICHAEL\nAnd you believed that story.\n\nFREDO\nHe said there was something good in\n\n\n\nit for me...me on my own.\n\nMICHAEL\nI've always taken care of you.\n\nFREDO\nTaken care of me.  Mike, you're my\nkid brother, and you take care of\nmy.  Did you ever think of that.\nEver once?  Send Fredo off to do\nthis, send Fredo to take care of\nthat... take care of some little\nunimportant night club here, and\nthere; pick somebody up at the\nairport.  Mike, I'm your older\nbrother; I was stepped over!\n\nMICHAEL\nIt's the way Pop wanted it.\n\nFREDO\nIt wasn't the way I wanted it!  I\ncan handle things.  I'm not dumb\nChrist, not like everyone says.\nI'm smart; and I want respect.\n\nMICHAEL\nThere's nothing more you can tell\nme about this investigation?\n\nFREDO\nThe lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to\nRoth.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou're nothing to me now, Fredo;\nnot a brother, not a friend, I\ndon't want to know you, or what\nhappens to you.  I don't want to\nsee you at the hotels, or near my\nhome.  When you visit our Mother, I\nwant to know a day in advance, so I\nwon't be there.  Do you understand?\n\nMichael turns, and starts to leave.  A frightened voice\nbehind him:\n\nFREDO\nMikey?\n\nMichael doesn't stop, doesn't turn back.  He continues off\nthrough the veranda, and out the summer doors.\n\nNeri stops by him.\n\nMICHAEL\nI don't want anything to happen to\nhim while my Mother's alive.\n\nMichael leaves.\n\nEXT. ARMY POST - DAY\n\nFive cars brimming with Army guards and Agents are waiting\nto move Pentangeli.  There is one empty car.\n\nINT. GUARDED HOUSE - DAY\n\nThe two FBI Agents are helping Pentangeli get dressed.  He's\n\n\n\nin brightly colored striped shorts and bare-chested.  The\nAgents help him with the shirt and tie.  One holds out the\ntrousers but Pentangeli ignores it and looks at himself in\nthe mirror.\n\nFBI MAN #1\nReady, Frankie.\n\nPENTANGELI\nLet's go.\n\nThe Agents open the door, and precede him, surveying the\narea.  They check the cars waiting, each with two Agents.\nThey check the gate and note the military sentries.  Then\nthey stand aside, and let Pentangeli come out.  They get\nclose to his side, and it is obvious they will protect his\nlife with their own.\n\nEXT. ARMY POST - DAY\n\nThe Agents put him in the front seat of the empty car, and\nget in with him, one at each side.  Another Agent drives.\nNow, the first cars start out; the Sentries opening the\ngates, and letting the caravan pass.\n\nAn Army supply truck comes very close to them, and the\nAgents next to Pentangeli become very tense.  Pentangeli\ngrins.  Then the truck passes on, and they relax.\n\nINT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - DAY\n\nThe room is crowded with TV journalists, cameras, etc.  We\npick Pentangeli up, closely guarded, being led to witness\nchair.\n\nPentangeli is seated, and made to take his oath.  FBI Agents\nare all around him.\n\nMED. VIEW\n\nAnyone given entrance to the caucus room is being frisked.\nThe five Senators take their places.\n\nVIEW ON HAGEN\n\nwaiting at his long table, very nervous.  He seems startled\nby the appearance of Pentangeli.\n\nVIEW ON PENTANGELI\n\ncatching Hagen's eye.  It's as though he is pleading for\nsome kind of understanding of the fact that he has become a\ntraitor.\n\nVIEW ON HAGEN\n\ncold; then he turns away.\n\nVIEW ON THE ENTRANCE\n\nThe bustle is settling down; then Michael Corleone enters,\nand with him is someone very peculiar and out of keeping for\nthis setting.  A burly-chested imposing man of middle age.\nVery powerful-looking with frightening magnetic eyes.  His\ndress is odd: boots, rough tie, and shirt.  He could be the\ntenor out of a Sicilian opera.  He is clearly a country Don,\ndirect from Sicily, and he dominates the room.\n\nVIEW ON PENTANGELI\n\n\n\nAt first his view is blocked.  Then he sees Michael and is a\nbit shamefaced, but still defiant.\n\nPENTANGELI'S POV\n\nMichael returns his glances without emotion.  Then the VIEW\nALTERS, revealing the Sicilian.\n\nVIEW ON PENTANGELI\n\nHe is terror stricken; obviously he recognizes the man.\n\nVIEW ON HAGEN'S TABLE\n\nMichael and the Sicilian sit by Hagen, where they can stare\ndirectly at Pentangeli; he is frozen with fear.\n\nVIEW ON THE SENATOR\n\nNotices the tension in the room.  The Chairman commences:\n\nSENATOR KANE\nWe have here a witness who will\ntestify further on Michael\nCorleone's rule of the criminal\nempire that controls gambling in\nthis country and perhaps in other\ncountries.  This witness had no\nbuffer between himself and Michael\nCorleone.  He can corroborate our\ncharges on enough counts for this\ncommittee to consider a charge of\nperjury against Michael Corleone.\n\n(then he turns to Pentangeli)\nYour name please, for the record.\n\nPENTANGELI\nFrank Pentangeli.\n\nSENATOR KANE\nWere you a member of the Corleone\nFamily?  Were you under the\nCaporegime Peter Clemenza, under\nVito Corleone, known as the\nGodfather?\n\nThere is a long silence.\n\nVIEW ON PENTANGELI\n\nHe seems unable to speak.\n\nVIEW ON THE SICILIAN\n\ngazing at him.\n\nVIEW ON PENTANGELI\n\nPENTANGELI\nI never knew no Godfather.

The two FBI men are alert, their\neyes searching the room for what has intimidated their\nwitness at the last moment.\n\nSENATOR KANE\nMr. Pentangeli, you are\n\n\n\ncontradicting your confessions to\nour investigators; I ask you again,\nwere you a member of a crime\norganization headed by Michael\nCorleone?\n\nPENTANGELI\nNo.  I never heard of it.  I never\nheard of nothing like that.  I was\nin the olive oil business with his\nfather a long time ago.  That's all.\n\nSENATOR KANE\nWe have your confession that you\nmurdered on the orders of Michael\nCorleone.  Do you deny that\nconfession and do you know what\ndenying that confession will mean\nto you?\n\nThe die is cast and like a good soldier, Pentangeli will go\nall the way now.  So he is brazen in his defiance of the\nSenator.\n\nPENTANGELI\nThe FBI guys promised me a deal.\nSo I made up a lot of stuff about\nMichael Corleone.  Because then,\nthat's what they wanted.  But it\nwas all lies.  Everything.  They\nsaid Michael Corleone did this,\nMichael Corleone did that.  So I\nsaid, \"Yeah, sure.\"\n\nHe makes a big grin to show how he has made fools of\neverybody.\n\nVIEW ON THE FBI AGENTS\n\nglancing around the room; their eyes have settled on the\nSicilian.

There may just be\na shadow of contempt.  He doesn't answer.\n\nHAGEN\nSir, the gentleman does not\nunderstand English.  He would not\nin any case, take the stand.  He\ncame, at his own expense, to aid\nhis brother in his trouble.  He is\nnot under any jurisdiction of our\ngovernment and his reputation in\nhis own country is impeccable.\n\nSENATOR KANE\n(furious)\n\nThe witness is excused; take him out.\n\nThe guards and FBI Agents quickly remove Pentangeli, as\neverybody else in the room is required to sit still.\n\nHAGEN\nSenator Kane.\n\nSENATOR KANE\nThis meeting is adjourned.\n\nHAGEN\n(rising and shouting)\n\nThis committee owes an apology!\n\nSENATOR KANE\nThe committee is adjourned until\nfurther notice.\n\nFor the first time, in the midst of the confusion, Hagen\nsmiles.

Also, the\nchildren - Michael, they're here.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhere?\n\nKAY\nIn a minute.  They're outside with\nEsther.  I'm very happy for you...\nI suppose I knew that you're simply\ntoo smart for anyone ever to beat\nyou.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhy don't you sit down?\n\nKAY\nI'm not going to stay long; I can't.\n\nMICHAEL\nThere are a lot of things I want to\ntalk to you about.  Things I've\nbeen thinking about -- changes I\nwant to make.\n\nKAY\nI think it's too late for changes,\nMichael.  I promised myself I\nwouldn't talk about it and I've\ngone and spoiled it.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhy too late?\n\nKAY\nTell me, Michael.  What really\nhappened with Pentangeli?\n\nMICHAEL\nHis brother came to help him.\n\nKAY\nI didn't even know he had a brother.\nAnd where is he now?\n\nMICHAEL\nOn a plane back to Sicily.\n\nKAY\nAnd that's all he had to do.  Just\nshow his face.\n\nMICHAEL\nThat's all.  You see, in Sicily, in\nthe old days... there was only one\nlegitimate reason to kill a blood\nrelative... only one.  IF he was a\ntraitor.\n\nKAY\nYou would have killed his brother?\n\nMICHAEL\nKay, you've got it wrong.  That\n\n\n\nkind of thing's all over, I promised\nyou.  This was between the two\nbrothers.  Years ago Frankie had a\nyoung girlfriend; he called her his\nco-wife.  That was his joke, but he\nmeant it.  He wouldn't divorce his\nwife... because she was a great\ncook.  He said he girlfriend made a\nspaghetti sauce once and it was so\nterrible he knew he could never\nmarry her.  He set her up in a\nhouse in Jersey.  She had to be\nfaithful... and she had to have kids.\nAnd she did, two, a boy and a girl.\nHe had her checked out and watched\nso she couldn't cheat... but the\ngirl couldn't stand that kind of\nlife.  She begged him to let her go.\nHe did.  He gave her money and made\nher give up the kids.  Then Frankie\ntook them to Italy, and had them\nbrought up by his brother Vincenzo.\nWhere he knew they'd by safe.\n\nKay begins to realize.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhen he saw his brother in the\nhearing room, he knew what was at\nstake.\n\n(pause)\nI don't think Vincenzo would have\ndone it.  He loves the kids, too.\nOmerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It\nhad nothing to do with me.  It was\nbetween those brothers.\n\nKAY\nI'll bring the children up now;\nthey want to say goodbye.\n\nMICHAEL\nKay, I told you...\n\nKAY\nGoodbye, Michael.\n\nMICHAEL\nI won't let you leave!  Christ, do\nyou think I'm going to let you leave.\n\nKAY\n(meekly)\n\nMichael.\n\nMICHAEL\nNo, I don't want to hear anything.\nThere are things between men and\nwomen that will not change; things\nthat have been the same for\nthousands of years.  You are my\nwife, and they are my children...\nand I love you and I will not let\nyou leave, because you are MINE!\n\nKAY\nOh, I do feel things for you,\nMichael; but now, I think it's pity.\nFor the first time since I've known\n\n\n\nyou, you seem so helpless.  You\nheld me a prisoner once; will you\ntry again?\n\nMICHAEL\nIf that's what it takes; then yes,\nI will.\n\nKAY\nAt this moment, I feel no love for\nyou at all.  I never thought that\ncould happen, but it has.\n\nMICHAEL\nWe'll go back tonight.  Bring the\nchildren.\n\nKAY\nYou haven't heard me.\n\nHe moves to her; he does love her, and is tender with her.\n\nMICHAEL\nHow can I let you leave; how can I\nlet you take my children away?\nDon't you know me?  You understand,\nit's an impossibility.  I would\nnever let it happen; no, never, not\nif it took all my strength, all my\ncunning.  But in time, soon, you'll\nfeel differently.  You see, you'll\nbe happy that I stopped you.  I\nknow you.  You'll forget about\nthis; you'll forget about the baby\nwe lost... and we'll go on, you and\nI.\n\nKAY\nThe baby I lost...\n\nMICHAEL\nI know what it meant... and I'm\nprepared to make it up to you.  I\nwill make changes; I can.\n\n(he clenches his fist tightly)\nI CAN change; that I have learned,\nthat I have the strength to change...\nAnd we have another child, a boy...\nand you'll forget the miscarriage.\n\nKAY\nIt wasn't a miscarriage.  And you\nwith your cunning, couldn't you\nfigure it out!  It was an abortion;\nan abortion, like our marriage is\nan abortion, something unholy and\nevil.  I don't want your son; I\nwouldn't bring another of your sons\ninto this world.  An abortion,\nMichael... it was a son, and I had\nit killed, but this must all end!\n\nVIEW ON MICHAEL\n\nHe had no hint, not in his wildest imagination could he have\nguessed that she would do such a thing.\n\nKAY\nAnd I know that now it's over; I\n\n\n\nknew it then, there would be no way\nyou could ever forgive me, not with\nthis Sicilian thing that goes back\ntwo thousand years.\n\nHe is silent, though raging -- then, with all his passion,\nand his strength, he raises his arms, and strikes her across\nher neck, literally knocking her down to the floor, and\nhurting her badly.\n\nMICHAEL\n(coldly)\n\nYou won't take my children.\n\nFADE OUT.\n\nFADE IN:\n\nEXT.

CLOSE VIEW\n\non Kay, kissing her boy.\n\nKAY\nAnthony, say goodbye; your Mama\nloves you.\n\nANTHONY\nGoodbye.\n\nShe restrains any tears; she has become too strong for tears.\nKay starts to go; picks up Mary, kisses her, and starts to go.\n\nNEW VIEW\n\n\n\nShe steps out the kitchen door; then she cannot help herself.\nCrouches down, outside, and calls to her son.\n\nKAY\nAnthony, kiss me once.\n\nThen she looks up, and slowly rises.\n\nHER VIEW\n\nMichael has stepped into the dining room.  He seems older\nsomehow; as though some sickness has taken more years away\nfrom him.\n\nVIEW ON KAY\n\nlooks at him; instinctively, she takes a step back.\n\nVIEW ON MICHAEL\n\nslowly steps toward her.\n\nVIEW ON KAY\n\nAnother step back; the door is still open.\n\nVIEW ON MICHAEL\n\nHe moves closer to the door; stops, looks at her.  And then\ncloses it obscuring any view of her.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT. TAHOE ESTATE - DAY\n\nIt is late fall -- most of the leaves have fallen on the\ngrounds and there is quite a wind.\n\nMED. VIEW\n\nThe water is whipped up by the wind, and the waves are high\nas they break against the pavilion.  We HEAR the MUSIC of\ntime passing, of Michael, of the Godfather over these images.\n\nVIEW ON THE SWIMMING POOLS\n\nThey have not been used in several months; they are drained\nand the bottoms are mossy and dark.\n\nVIEW ON THE MAIN GATE\n\nLeaves blowing past it; we don't see the button men; only a\nhint of someone in the gatehouse.\n\nVIEW ON THE HOUSES\n\nSome of the houses have had the summer awnings taken down,\nand put away.  Some of the windows have been boarded up.\n\nVIEW ON THE KENNELS\n\nThere are still the guard dogs; some sleeping, some moving\nimpatiently.\n\nAs the MUSIC concludes its statement.\n\nMED. VIEW\n\n\n\nThe peninsula of the private Corleone Harbor.  We see the\nfigures of two people, seated at a table.\n\nMED. VIEW\n\nMichael sits at a table having a sparse lunch.  He is\nattended by his sister Connie, who seems to be the closest\nperson now living on the estate with him.  We see from the\nway she pampers him with his lunch, that she has fallen into\nthe role of a surrogate Mother-Wife.  He seems older than\nhis years, as though his illness, diabetes, has taken its\ntoll.\n\nCONNIE\nDon't worry; I'm sure he got here\non time.  The roads from the\nairport are so windy, it takes\nforever; I've driven them myself.\n\nShe picks up some of the serving plates that he has left\nuntouched.\n\nCONNIE\nI'll bring him out to you as soon\nas he comes.\n\nShe moves back to the main house.\n\nMED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL\n\nHe turns and looks at the rough water of the lake for a\nmoment.  He slowly takes a sip of wine.\n\nEXT. A PLACE IN THE GARDEN - DAY\n\nThere are a few chairs.\n\nMED. VIEW ON ANTHONY CORLEONE\n\nHe is eighteen years old.\n\nANTHONY\nHello, Dad.\n\nVIEW ON MICHAEL\n\nsquinting up at his son.\n\nMICHAEL\nAnthony.\n\nHe rises, and reaches up to his son, who is now taller than\nhe; he embraces him.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou've grown so tall... so tall in\nthe last year.  You're much taller\nthan me.\n\nANTHONY\nI was taller than you when I was\nfourteen.\n\nMICHAEL\nSit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I\nwaited for you to have some lunch,\nbut now it's all dried out.\n\nANTHONY\n\n\n\nI'm not hungry.\n\nMICHAEL\nWell, that's alright... alright.\nGood.  You'll graduate in another\nyear, isn't that right?  You know...\nI never finished college.  I was a\ngood student, but I never finished.\nOf course, there was a war then.\n\nConnie approaches them.\n\nCONNIE\nDon't let me interrupt anything,\nthis will just take a second.  Here.\n\n(she takes out a\nsmall needle, and\nbegins to prepare it)\n\nYour father has to have his insulin\nshot.  Why don't you go to your\nroom and put your things away,\nAnthony.\n\nShe begins to give Michael the shot.\n\nMICHAEL\nHurry back; we'll talk.  We'll talk.\n\nAnthony goes on his way to the house with his things.\nConnie gives Michael the shot.\n\nCONNIE\nWhenever I see that lake so cold, I\nthink of poor Fredo, drowned.  Lake\nTahoe is very cold.  They say if a\nperson drowns in it, that the body\nwill remain mid-suspended --\nperfectly preserved.  Some say it\nwill remain forever.\n\nShe finishes the shot, puts her things away.\n\nCONNIE\nYour boy will be right back.\n\nShe leaves.\n\nVIEW ON MICHAEL\n\nAlone in the garden.\n\nOUR VIEW begins to MOVE CLOSER to him.  We begin to HEAR\nMUSIC of the forties; happy music, swing music, as we move\nCLOSER to Michael.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT. OLD CORLEONE HOUSE - MED. VIEW - NIGHT\n\nSONNY CORLEONE, his arm wrapped around a smiling red-faced\nCarlo Rizzi, pulls him into the Corleone dining room.\n\nSONNY\nHey, who knows my buddy Carlo Rizzi.\nHere... my brother Fredo, here's my\nMom.  Mom, whatcha got cooking?\nAnd Carlo, this is my kid sister\nConnie.  Here, pull up a chair,\nCarol is sitting next to Connie.\n\n\n\nOh, the droopy kid over there is\nMike.  The college boy.\n\nAn older, lanky man enters the room, his arms laden with\npresents.  This is TESSIO.\n\nTESSIO\nBuon Natale, everybody.  Buon\nNatale...\n\n(he smiles at Tom Hagen)\nHi, Tom, how's every little thing?\n\nHAGEN\n(helping him with the presents)\n\nWonderful, Sal.\n\nNow the study door opens, and DON CORLEONE enters.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nIs dinner ready?\n\nMOM\nTwo minutes.\n\nThe Don happily regards his family; his sons and daughters\nand even some Grandchildren.  He raises a glass.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nA good life, a long life to all my\nchildren, and friends.  To my\ngrandchildren, and those that will\nbe.  To our family.\n\nThey all drink.\n\nThey refill glasses; then Tessio proposes a toast.\n\nTESSIO\nTo our Godfather.\n\nThey all drink.\n\nINT. THE DINING ROOM - MED. VIEW - NIGHT\n\nThe family is happily at Christmas dinner.  Don Corleone\nseated at the head of the table.\n\nSONNY\nWhat'd you think of those Japs, eh?\nThe nerve of those Japs, coming\nright here in our own backyard\ndropping bombs!\n\nHAGEN\nWell, we could have expected it\nafter the embargo.\n\nSONNY\nHey!  Expect it or not, those Japs\ndon't have a right to drop bombs in\nour backyard.  Whose side you on?\n\nMAMA\nPlease, do we have to talk about\nthe war at the table?  On Christmas,\nmuch less.\n\nVIEW ON MICHAEL\n\n\n\nHe has been listening to this discussion.\n\nMICHAEL\nPop, I've decided I'm going to\nenlist.\n\nA quiet hush descends over the table, as though everyone\nknows the effect this will have on the old man.  Sonny tries\nto make light of it.\n\nSONNY\nKid, stay in college.  The girls\nare cuter, if you know what I mean.\n\nHAGEN\nPop had to pull a lot of strings to\nget you your deferment.\n\nMICHAEL\nI never asked for it; I don't want\nit.\n\nVIEW ON DON CORLEONE\n\nDisturbed; but wise and prudent.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nMy son wants to talk about this,\nand so we'll talk, but not at the\ndinner table.\n\nHe rises, and starts across the room toward his study.  Then\nhe looks back.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nMichael.\n\nHe disappears into his study.  Michael rises, glances around.\nPeople are generally tense over the situation.  Michael\nfollows his father into the study.\n\nINT. DON CORLEONE'S OLD STUDY - NIGHT\n\nThe Don closes the door behind his son, and then moves\nacross the room.  He stops at the little bar there, and\npours himself a brandy.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWould you like some?\n\nMICHAEL\nNo, Dad.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNow what is this talk about joining\nthe army?  Eh?\n\nMICHAEL\nIt's not talk; I'm doing it.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nYou would risk your life for\nstrangers?\n\nMICHAEL\nNot for strangers; for my country.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAnyone not in your family, is a\n\n\n\nstranger.  Believe me, when trouble\ncomes, your country won't take care\nof you.\n\nMICHAEL\nThat's how it was in the old world,\nPop, but this is not Sicily.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI know.  I know, Michael.  It's\nChristmas, your brothers and sister\nare all here -- we are happy.\nLet's not spoil this.  Go your own\nway, but when you are ready, come\nto me the way a son should.  I have\nhopes for you...\n\nCLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL\n\nlooking at his father with a mixture of great love, and also\nfear, and confusion.\n\nMICHAEL\nI won't be a man like you.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT. THE TAHOE ESTATE - HIGH FULL VIEW - DAY\n\nThe leaves are blowing.  MUSIC comes up.\n\nMichael and his young son, Anthony, walk through the grounds\nof the estate, talking about things we cannot hear.",

    "## FIG 1: Smoothed Emotion Evolution of Michael Corleone\n",
    " #### This figure plots the smoothed evolution of emotional language used by Michael Corleone across The Godfather Part I and Part II.\n",
    " #### Specifically, it shows: Positive emotion word counts (smoothed) & Negative emotion word counts (smoothed) for Part I and Part II separately. Each curve is a 15-line rolling average, which smooths out noise from individual dialogue lines.\n",
    " #### X-axis (Dialogue Sequence) represents the chronological order of Michael’s dialogue lines in each film. A higher value means later in the movie.    Y-axis (Smoothed Emotion Word Count) represents the average number of positive or negative emotion words per dialogue line over the previous 15 lines.\n",
    " ##### Blue: Positive emotion in Part I, \n",
    " ##### Orange: Negative emotion in Part IGreen: Positive emotion in Part II\n",
    " ##### Red: Negative emotion in Part II\n",
    "### A rise in a curve indicates a cluster of emotionally charged dialogue rather than a single emotional line\n",
    "### Key interpretation\n",
    "#### In Part I, Michael’s dialogue shows greater emotional variation, with both positive and negative spikes. This reflects his internal conflict and gradual involvement in the family business.\n",
    "#### In Part II, positive emotion spikes are smaller and less frequent, while negative emotion clusters are more pronounced and persistent.The reduced volatility in Part II suggests Michael becomes emotionally controlled, colder, and more calculated."
